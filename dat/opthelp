               extra screen output when attempting to pause for
               display effect.  on MSDOS without the termcap
               lib, whether or not to pause for visual effect.    [TRUE]

Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

boulder       override the default boulder symbol with another default: [`]
disclose      the types of information you want offered at the end of the
              game  [ni na nv ng nc]
dumpfile      the name of the file where to dump the disclosure information
              when the game ends (only if the patch has been compiled in)
              [none]
fruit         the name of a fruit you enjoy eating  [slime mold]
              (basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time).
menustyle     user interface for selection of multiple objects:
              Traditional -- one object at a time prompting;
              Combination -- prompt for classes of interest, then menu;
              Partial     -- skip class prompt, use menu of all objects;
              Full        -- menu for classes of interest, then object menu;
              only the first letter ('T','C','P','F') matters; 'N' (None)
              is a synonym for 'T', as is boolean style negation  [Full]
packorder     a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
              order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
              (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
              default order will be appended to the end.)
paranoid      ask for confirmation before doing any of the following:
              hit         -- attacking a peaceful monster       [TRUE]
              quit        -- quitting the game                  [TRUE]

              level (Unburdened, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,
              or overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to continue. [S]
pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to autopickup
              when that option is on  [all]

              teleport -- don't update map until movement stops;
              run      -- periodically update map (interval is seven steps);
              walk     -- update map after every step;
              crawl    -- like walk, but delay after making each step.
              (This only affects screen display, not actual movement.)  [run]
scores        the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
              You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
              scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]
sortloot      controls the sortloot patch [none]:
              full -- All pickup lists of items are sorted by item description
              loot -- When inventory letters are shown, has no effect.
                      Otherwise sorts by description
              none -- Works the traditional way, like without the patch

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

align      Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral,
           or align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  [RANDOM]
catname    the name of your first cat  [NONE]
dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
dungeon    a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
           drawing the dungeon.
           The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
           that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
           indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
           As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
           Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
           given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes:
           stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')

           sw_midl, sw_midr,            (swallow, middle row [no center])
           sw_botl, sw_botm, sw_botr                (swallow, bottom row)
           extl extm extr                      (explosion matrix top row)
           exml exmm exmr                   (explosion matrix middle row)
           exbl exbm exbr                   (explosion matrix bottom row)
           default:  |-\\/*!)(0#@*/-\\||\\-//-\\|\ |\\-/
gender     Your starting gender (gender:male or gender:female).
           You may specify just the first letter.  Although you can
           still denote your gender using the "male" and "female"
           options, the "gender" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]
horsename  the name of your first horse  [NONE]
menu_*     create single character accelerators for menu commands.  Below
           is a list of all commands.  Each is followed by a list of window-

role       Your starting role (e.g., role:Barbarian, role:Valk).
           Although you can specify just the first letter(s), it will
           choose only the first role it finds that matches; thus, it
           is recommended that you spell out as much of the role name
           as possible.  You can also still denote your role by
           appending it to the "name" option (e.g., name:Vic-V), but the
           "role" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]

           arrow_trap dart_trap falling_rock_trap squeaky_board
           bear_trap land_mine rolling_boulder_trap sleeping_gas_trap

msg_window the type of message window to use:
           single      -- One message at a time
