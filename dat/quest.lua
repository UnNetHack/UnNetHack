Tutorial: WELCOME

Welcome to UnNetHack! These tutorial messages will help to teach you
how to play the game. (Use ? for more in-depth help on the game.)

The screen generally contains (non-tutorial) messages at the top (if
any), information about your character at the bottom (this will be
explained later), and a map in between.  Each symbol on the screen
represents something; you are the @ sign (which might be hidden behind
this message at the moment, but you'll be able to see it most of the
time), and the screen will show what you can see and what you can
remember.  In general, letters (and a few symbols like ' : ; & and @)
represent creatures (which could be friendly or hostile); and most
punctuation marks represent either dungeon features (such as - and |
for walls and doors, # for corridors, and . for the floor), or items
(such as $ for gold).  Eventually you'll know the symbols off by heart;
while you're learning, you can press / for a reminder of what any
symbol means, or ; to find out what any object on the map is.

Let's start by looking around a bit; close this message with the
spacebar, then press ; so that you can look at nearby objects.]],

Tutorial: CURSOR MOVEMENT (with the number pad)

In order to specify what you want to look at, you have to be able to
move the cursor.  You may be used to thinking of four directions in
which an object can move; but NetHack has eleven:

sideways, not upwards or downwards, so only bother with the numbers

Tutorial: PETS

The Mazes of Menace may be a dangerous and hostile place to adventure
in, but luckily, you don't have to do it alone.  You start each game
with a tame kitten (f), little dog (d), or pony (u); they will follow
you around the dungeon, and fight monsters with you.  Your pet can
mostly take care of itself; for instance, it will try to feed itself
with the corpses of enemy monsters to prevent itself becoming hungry,
and back out of fights it thinks it will lose.  Over time, as the pet
gets more practice, it will get better at combat, and may grow into a
larger animal; and to start with, your pet may well be better at
combat than you are; a useful friend for an inexperienced character.

Note that your pet can't follow you everywhere; if you go up or down
stairs, your pet will only be able to follow if it's next to you at
the time, and will otherwise become stranded and may go wild.  In
general, if you want to make sure you keep track of your pet, keep it
close by whenever you can.

If you aren't sure what to do next, use the cursor movement keys to
walk around, or use ; to look at more things around you.]],

Tutorial: MONSTERS

That's a hostile monster, one of the huge number of threats facing you
in the Mazes of Menace.  Note that monsters are only displayed onscreen
if your character can see them; therefore, it can be important to try
to get the best view of what's ahead that you can, and be especially
wary in dark corridors!

There are several ways to deal with enemy monsters.  Although often you
can simply run away, that can leave you backed into a corner, and some
monsters will be able to outrun you; even so, that option is often
worth considering.  More usually, you'll want to kill the monster;
common methods are fighting it hand-to-hand ('in melee'), using
missiles, and casting spells.

To attack a monster in melee, simply walk into it, and you'll hit the
monster with whatever you're holding in your hands.  Movement in the
dungeon is done the same way as moving the cursor; you can even move
diagonally like this. (Melee should be good enough to beat most early
monsters, although many characters will have a better method of
fighting.) Try fighting that monster now!]],

      qt_tutorial_look_peaceful = {
         output = "text",

Tutorial: PEACEFUL MONSTERS AND ALIGNMENT

Not all monsters are out to kill everyone they meet; many monsters will
have more sense than that.  Many monsters can be very dangerous when
angered; so it's often a good idea to leave peaceful monsters be.  If a
peaceful monster is blocking your way, try waiting a few turns (press
the . key in order to wait a turn) to see if they move out of the way.

Amongst the factors that determine how a monster will react to you,
one of the most important is alignment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic);
monsters which have a similar outlook on life to you are more likely
to be non-aggressive.  You can see your alignment in the status area
near the bottom of the screen, or by pressing control-X; this also
lets you know about the connected area of religion (sharing an
alignment implies sharing a god).  Note that although lawful behaviour
tends to be good, and evil behaviour tends to be chaotic, legal and
ethical do not always coincide.

One useful form of interaction with certain peaceful and tame monsters
is to chat to them using #chat; you'll see the outcome of the
conversation at the top of the screen.]],
      },
      qt_tutorial_look_invisible = {
         output = "text",
         text = [[
Tutorial: INVISIBLE MONSTERS

It looks like there's something around here you can't see! This might
be because the monster is invisible, or you might not be able to see
it for some other reason.  Either way, fighting it could be difficult.

Unlike all other letters, the letter I on the map is special; instead
of indicating a monster you can see right now, it indicates where an
invisible monster was the last time you determined its location.  You
can fight an I the same way you fight any other monster (e.g. you can
fight it in melee by walking into it), but the monster might have
moved since you discovered where it was, in which case your attack
will miss altogether.

If you think an invisible monster has moved, you can use the F and m
commands; F followed by a movement direction attacks an adjacent
square even if there's apparently nothing there, and m followed by a
movement direction walks onto a square even if you remember a monster
was there.  Searching around you by pressing s may also be helpful;
it's considerably easier to feel an invisible monster next to you than
it is to find a secret door or trap.]],

      qt_tutorial_doors = {
         output = "text",
         text = [[
Tutorial: DOORS AND DOORWAYS

Closed doors are represented by the + character; open doors are by
default represented by a | or - character, perpendicular to the wall
that they're on (although your options may be set to show it in a more
stylish way, to avoid it getting muddled with a wall).  A closed door
is a rather obvious obstacle to any adventurer, but there are several
ways to deal with one.  Probably the most obvious method of getting
past a door is to try to open it; to do that, just try to walk into it
or stand adjacent to the door, press o, and specify the direction that
the door is in.  Some doors are locked; in this case, you'll have to
either pick the lock (by using the a command to use a lock-picking
tool, if you have one), or kick the door down using control-D.

Open doors are less obviously obstacles, but they still hamper
movement to some extent, as it's impossible to move diagonally into or
out of an open doorway; you have to approach it straight.  You can also
close an open door by pressing c when standing adjacent to it; because
most monsters don't know how to, or physically can't, open doors, this
can be useful for shutting out monsters.]],
      },
      qt_tutorial_corridor = {
         output = "text",
         text = [[
Tutorial: CORRIDORS AND LIGHTING

Up here near the top of the dungeon, the vast majority of rooms are
going to be well-lit; you can see anything that's on a lit square,
unless there's a wall or other equally solid object in the way,
blocking your view.  When a square does go out of sight, your character
won't be able to see it, but your memory of it will continue to be
displayed on the map; monsters shown on the square will be removed,
because monsters tend to walk around, but any items or dungeon
features on the square will continue to be displayed (and you can
use ; to find out what they were, if you've forgotten).

Corridors are generally represented by the # symbol (your options may
be set to use a slightly more artistic representation); the solid rock
that borders them is just displayed with blank space.  Corridors are
generally dark; unless you illuminate them yourself somehow, you'll
only be able to fully see the squares adjacent to you (as well as any
lit squares in the distance, if there's no solid object in the way).
Take extra care in corridors; you might suddenly end up next to a
monster you couldn't previously see, due to being too far away!]],

         output = "text",

Tutorial: SECRET DOORS AND CORRIDORS

Not everything in these dungeons is quite as it seems.  Amongst dungeon
designers, it's a common habit to hide some of the connections between
one room and the next, and this dungeon is no exception.

A secret door or corridor just looks like normal rock or a normal
wall, until it's discovered; the usual way to discover one is to
carefully search the area around it.  If you think you're standing
adjacent to such a secret passage, you can use the s command to start
looking for it; however, it can take a beginning character quite a lot
of searching to find anything even if there is something there, so
it's often necessary to press s several times. (And of course, all
that searching will be in vain if there is in fact nothing there!)
Good places to search are in apparent dead-ends, and similar
situations where it seems likely that there's a way forward, but you
can't see what it is.

This is a good place to try searching, because there is a door or
corridor hidden adjacent to your current location; try pressing s
until you find it, although note that searching takes time.]],

Tutorial: WATER

Water (by default represented as a } character, but this is often
customized to show as something else) is yet another of the hazards
you may end up facing.  Generally speaking, a typical adventurer won't
be able to cross large bodies of water without magical aid; although
in some cases, it may be possible to carefully move through a swamp by
avoiding water squares.  Diagonal movement might be helpful here.

Be very careful when moving near water; falling in may cause your
character severe problems, although it isn't normally instantly fatal
unless you're so burdened you can't climb back out.  It's often a good
strategy to find an alternative route through this level, if there is
one.]],

Tutorial: LAVA

Lava, like water, is represented by the } character (or other custom
character representing liquid); you can use the ; command to tell
water and lava apart, or (if playing in colour) by looking at the
colour difference.  You need to be even more careful around lava than
you are around water; few adventurers have the levels of magical
protection needed to be able to swim through lava safely, so a typo
near lava could be instantly fatal.  Because NetHack is a turn-based
game, there's no need to react to anything quickly in real-time; so
take your time over your moves!]],
      },
      qt_tutorial_stairs = {
         output = "text",

Tutorial: STAIRS

The > and < characters represent flights of stairs (going down and up
respectively); you can climb down stairs in order to go deeper in the
dungeon.  The commands for traversing a flight of stairs are the same
as the characters representing the stairs themselves; and likewise,
the same as the keys representing the vertical directions.  Note that
climbing up and down stairs can be difficult if you're holding too
much equipment; for instance, excess weight may cause you to fall down
the stairs, taking damage in the process.

If you can't see the stairs that let you move down from any given
level, try looking underneath items; failing that, bear in mind the
possibility that there may be a secret door or corridor somewhere
leading to another part of the current level. (Of course, the dungeon
isn't infinitely deep; so it's possible you'll find the bottom level,
which has no downstairs.  But that isn't something to worry about just
now.)

Note that the stairs that go up from level 1 lead out of the dungeon;
the game will end if you use them.]],

Tutorial: FOUNTAINS

The { character represents a fountain; it's possible to walk through a
square with a fountain on, but also to interact with the fountain.
Most commonly, an adventurer who chooses to use a fountain will either
want to drink from it, or dip something into it; in either case, this
is accomplished by standing on the square of the fountain, and using
one of the following commands:

    q   Drink (quaff) from the fountain
 #dip   Dip something into the fountain

Tutorial: GRAVES

The lure of a treasure-filled dungeon is great, and as a result there
tend to be many adventurers seeking their fortune in any given
dungeon.  Even though you're the only person here today, there will
have been many other adventurers who sought their fortune, and died
here, in the past; and you just found the grave of one.

Graves are signified by the | symbol inside a room; they don't block
your movement.  If the adventurer in question died very recently, then
their body and possessions will likely still exist in the same
location; and quite possibly, so will their ghost, and whatever killed
them! Otherwise, the corpse, along with some of the possessions, will
be buried underground, and if you feel like grave-robbing, you'll have
to dig them up somehow.

Note that it's very common for the possessions of dead adventurers to

Tutorial: ALTARS

Religion is an important feature of NetHack; although the gods take
note of your actions all the time, an altar (_) is a good place to go
to contact them more directly.  It's important to know who an altar is
dedicated to; to do this, stand on the altar and press the : key.
(Using : will tell you more information about the square you're on.)
As a reminder: your %G is %d.

One common use of an altar is to sacrifice the corpse of a monster to
the appropriate deity; to do this, stand on the altar, with a corpse
in your inventory or on the altar, and use the #offer command.  As long
as your %G is not offended by the sacrifice, this will generally
have a pleasing effect; sometimes, your %G will give you gifts in
return for your sacrifices.

Prayer (using #pray) is also more effective when standing on your own
%G's altar; prayer is used to request help from the gods, usually
in emergencies.  Deities don't like being pestered too much, so try not
to request divine intervention too often; most of the time, you'll
want to save your prayers for when you're in mortal danger.]],

Tutorial: TRAPS

The ^ symbol represents a trap.  Traps can have a variety of effects,
but generally speaking you want to avoid them; you can look at a trap
with ; to see what it does (or use ^ and a direction when next to it,
if it's buried under items and you can't see the ^ as a result).  Some
traps can be dismantled using the #untrap command when adjacent to the
trap; although scavenging the parts that make up a trap can be useful,
it's entirely possible that your character will set the trap off by
mistake when doing so, so be careful and make sure you aren't badly
injured before you try.  The #untrap command can also be used to check
chests and doors for traps, although not with a perfect success rate.

Walking round a trap is normally the best option; although if it's
blocking your way and you can't dismantle it, there may be some more
ingenious way to either avoid its effects, or to prevent it
functioning correctly when stepped on.]],

Tutorial: ESCAPING THE DUNGEON

That < is a flight of stairs going upwards (likewise, a > is a flight

used to enter the dungeon.  If you go up those stairs (by using the <
command), you'll walk straight out of the dungeon and end the game.

Leaving the dungeon via the stairs is known as 'escaping'; escaping
the dungeon is not nearly as bad as death (especially if you get out
with a lot of treasure!), but it isn't really an ideal end to the
game, as you haven't achieved the major aim of the game (offering the
Amulet of Yendor to your god).  Of course, if you somehow manage to get
the Amulet of Yendor, there's nothing wrong with taking it out of the
dungeon in an attempt to find an altar to your god somewhere on the
surface, so you can offer the Amulet; the game will continue if you do
this.

Note that once you've left the dungeon wih a character, either with or
without the Amulet, it's impossible to re-enter the dungeon; in order
to play there again, you'll have to start a new game, with a new
character, if you escape.]],

Tutorial: AUTOMATIC TRAVEL

Moving back to places in the dungeon that you've already explored can
be a tedious task; luckily, it's possible to automate your movement
somewhat.

The _ command will prompt you for a location anywhere on the current
level; it'll then automatically move you along the shortest path you
know to that location.  This doesn't save you any time in-game, but it
can save a lot of real-life time pressing the keys to move back to the
known location one at a time.

In addition, you can aim for a particular location by map symbol; for
instance, you can press _>. to automatically travel to a visible
downstairs, or __. to automatically travel to an altar.  This is
particularly useful when going back through several already-explored
levels of the dungeon to reach something higher up.

Travelling will stop automatically if it comes across something
interesting, such as an engraving or a monster.]],

Tutorial: ITEM PROMPTS

You're about to be asked to choose an item; this probably happened
because you wanted to do something like wear armor or read a scroll,
and the game needed to know which piece of armor to wear, or which
scroll to read.  Each item in your inventory is given a letter (case
matters), that you can use to represent the item; so for instance, if
you wanted to wield a weapon in 'slot' a, you could press a in order
to choose that weapon.  The prompt will let you know which slots
contain plausible items for the command you selected.

What if you can't remember what's in which slot? There are two more
options for the prompt: ? will give you a list of all the items that
the game thinks are likely choices (such as weapons for a wield
command), and * will give you a list of all the items you have, even
if it would apparently make no sense. (This lets you try out unusual
tactics, such as throwing items which aren't normally thrown, or
wielding things other than weapons.) You can choose the item you want
to use from the resulting menu.

save weight, or remove both your rings so you can put two different
rings on.

The A command allows you to take off armor, remove rings and amulets,
unwield weapons, empty your quiver, and unready a secondary weapon;

When there are a lot of similar-looking monsters around, it can be

you concentrate on attacking just one monster, rather than spreading

give your pet a name, so you can recognise it if you somehow become
separated from it and it goes wild.

d, except that you can specify more than one item to drop; but no
matter how many items you're dropping, it only takes one turn.

entire sets of items you want to get rid of, and drop them.  This trick
works in all multiple-select menus, not just d's. (The other menu

goes to the first page, ~ inverts all items on this page, | goes to
the last page, > goes to the next page, < goes to the previous page,

fire; instead, the item chosen is the one in your quiver. (Some
characters will start out with their quiver already filled.) The
quiver is simply a convenience option; it doesn't actually do anything
other than selecting an item to throw each time, as everything in your

Tutorial: OBJECTIVE

So, why are you here anyway? Like any adventurer, you might just be
here for the treasure; there are plenty of coins and gems in the

Your score will depend mainly on how much treasure you gather, and how
many monsters you kill, although other things affect it too.

More importantly, though, there's a rather significant artifact in the
dungeon; somewhere, probably rather deep down, is the fabled Amulet of
Yendor, allegedly desired even by the gods.  You would almost certainly
be rewarded greatly, maybe even with immortality, if you could find it
and offer it to your %G %d.

However, to start with, you should just worry about survival and
exploration.  Staying alive, gathering equipment to make yourself more
powerful, and practicing combat are all good aims early on; and you'll
want to explore the dungeon in order to gain an idea of where you want
to go.  Even though you'll eventually want to go for the Amulet, you'll

Tutorial: SAVING AND QUITTING

Unlike many other games, in NetHack, death is final; you have to start
a new game from the start (there's no way to save a game and load the
save file more than once).  However, if you need to take a break, you
can save the game by pressing S; that will save and end the game.  To
reload a save file, just run NetHack again (and if applicable, specify
the same name that you specified last time); the game will load, but
your save file will be deleted.

If you really get fed up of a game, you can use #quit in order to give
up and end the game; quitting a game will end it permanently, though,
because there's no way to go back to an earlier state in a game.  So
only do this when you want to abandon the game forever.  Quitting does
give a slightly higher final score than death, though.

You can also effectively quit simply by escaping the dungeon using the
stairs that you entered by; leaving the dungeon without the Amulet of
Yendor counts as "escaping", and although you survive with all your
equipment, and your life, intact, the game will end there, and you'll

Tutorial: REVIEWING MESSAGES

By now, you're likely to have seen many messages appear at the top of
the screen.  That space is used to convey any information that can't

results of looking at something using the ; command, explains what's
going on during a fight, and lets you know about things your character

message.  You can press control-P in order to review messages that
you've heard recently; depending on your options, it might either
display lots of recent messages, or only the most recent (in which
case repeating control-P will tell you about older messages).

If you want to do the opposite, and skip large numbers of messages,
then you can use escape at the --More-- prompt in order to skip the
remaining messages that turn (they can still be reviewed via
control-P, however). (In order to go on to the next message at a

Tutorial: SPELLCASTING

Although so far you've probably been using melee in combat, most
spellcaster characters won't be good enough at fighting to beat
everything in melee; against more powerful opponents, a different
option will be needed.  Therefore, it's probably a good time to get
some practice casting spells.

To cast a spell, use the Z command; you can only cast spells in the
eight compass directions (and up, down, and at yourself).  For this
combat, "force bolt" is probably a good spell to use; it's easy to
cast, and can do decent amounts of damage even when used by weak
spellcasters.  Why not try it on a nearby hostile monster?

In order to power a spell, you'll need to use up some of your personal
magical power; the effort also tends to make you burn food faster.
Your magical power is listed as Pw near the bottom of the screen; it's
depleted by casting spells, and fills up again over time.  To start
with, it'll be too low to cast any but the simplest spells, but as

Tutorial: THROWN WEAPONS

Although fighting monsters in melee is all very well, it helps if you
can get some hits in before you close in for the kill; a weakened
monster will die faster, and so will deal less damage to you in the
process.

You can throw items at a monster using the t command; good weapons to
throw include darts (which are designed for throwing), and daggers
(which work just as well thrown as when wielded).  Some characters will
be better with certain weapons than others; you can use #enhance to
see how skilled you are with various weapons (if a weapon is listed as
'unskilled', you don't know how to use it yet but can learn with
practice; if it isn't listed at all, you won't be able to learn to use
it no matter how much you practice).

Note that even spellcasters can benefit from thrown weapons; because
your magical power (Pw) can run out quickly if you rely on spells as
your major method of combat, using darts or daggers as a backup can be
an important tactic while you're waiting for your magical power to
recharge.]],

Tutorial: PROJECTILE WEAPONS

Using bows, crossbows, and slings is slightly more complicated than
fighting in melee; but the ability to hit monsters from a distance is
an important one, because it allows you to hit many monsters several
times before they can hit back, meaning you can kill them faster and
take less damage as a result.  In order to fire a projectile weapon,
you must wield the weapon (with w), then throw the projectile (using
t); the combination is recognised as firing the projectile with the
weapon, rather than throwing it by hand.

As bashing monsters with a bow or sling is unlikely to do much damage,
it's probably a bad idea to try to use a wielded projectile in melee;
instead, when the opposing monster has almost caught up to you, use
your turn to wield a melee weapon (using w) rather than trying to get
in a final shot.

You can use the #enhance command to see which weapons (including
projectile weapons) your character is good with ('basic' or better),
which they need practice to use ('unskilled'), and which they can
never learn to use effectively (unlisted).]],

Tutorial: ENGRAVING "ELBERETH"

As you go deeper into the dungeon, the monsters get more and more
dangerous, meaning you'll have to get better at combat yourself; and
if you aren't careful, you might easily be overwhelmed.  However,
there's a way to give yourself a bit of breathing space when you're
being swarmed with monsters.

You can write on the floor using a wand or your fingers, using the E
command (E- writes with your fingers); and there is one word that the
vast majority of monsters fear, the word "Elbereth".  Writing it on the
ground will therefore cause many monsters to flee from you in terror,
giving you a breathing space to recover from your wounds.

However, there are several problems with this method, too.  For one
thing, writing in the dust with your fingers is not the most accurate
method of inscription, so it's possible that one or more of the
letters will be malformed.  Also, engravings tend to get scuffed up a
lot by movement; fighting from an Elbereth square will almost
certainly wipe out the engraving and make it ineffective.  Finally,
despite the word's power, some monsters simply aren't scared of it.]],

Tutorial: MORE ABOUT MELEE

When attacking monsters in melee, you hit them with whatever you're
wielding in your hands.  However, some weapons are going to work better
than others; it helps to use a weapon your character has had lots of
practice with.

Your ability scores also have an effect on how effective melee can be.
Your Strength (St:) and Dexterity (Dx:) are shown at the bottom of the
screen; higher ability scores are better, and different abilities
affect different things.  Dexterity is imporant in being able to hit
enemies; a good dexterity helps you aim better both with melee and
with thrown and projectile weapons.  Strength is also important; it
helps to be strong to be able to aim a melee weapon accurately in
combat, and the stronger you are, the more damage you can do with it
if you connect.

Finally, some weapons will be more powerful than others, especially
against specific opponents.  For instance, you can expect swords to
generally hurt your enemies more than daggers do.  However, note that
your ability with the weapons in question will be just as important.]],

Tutorial: GOLD

Every adventurer loves gold; and it can be quite useful even within

no space in your inventory (but its weight can still be significant,
even though coins are quite light); the amount of gold you have is
constantly displayed near the bottom of the screen, rather than in
your inventory.

Gold adds to your score at the end of the game; but even within the
dungeon, it can still be used to buy things.  Not every monster is
hostile, and some will want to trade with you; and gold is the perfect
medium to trade with.  In particular, you may find shops which will buy
and sell items, in which case you'll want gold to be able to afford
things; but shopkeepers are not the only monsters who care about how
rich you are.

You can get information about your financial situation by using the $

if you owe, or are owed, money, that information will also be
available that way.]],

Tutorial: WEAPONS

With the number of hostile monsters in the dungeon, weapons tend to be
rather important.  Weapons on the map are represented with the ) symbol
(note that ammunition also counts as a weapon for this purpose).

You can use the w command to hold an object in your hands (or w- to
hold nothing); by far the most common use of this is to hold a weapon.
The object in your hands is what you'll use to hit monsters with in
melee, so it should be something that your character is skilled with
attacking with; you can use the #enhance command to see which weapons
your character is good at using ('unskilled' means your character
doesn't yet know how to use the weapon but can learn; if a weapon
isn't mentioned, your character will never know how to use it).

Other uses of weapons include using t to throw them at things (darts
are best used as thrown weapons, daggers are also good for this);
using a to hit targets two squares away (if you have a long weapon
like a lance); and using E to scratch into the floor with the weapon

Tutorial: ARMOR

Armor (represented by the [ character) is a useful method of
protecting yourself from the blows of your enemies; armor reduces the
chance that an enemy attack will hit, and may also reduce the damage
it deals.  Your vulnerability to attacks is called your Armor Class
(AC, shown at the bottom of the screen); an unarmored human has an AC
of 10, but you'll want to drive it much lower than that.

You can wear armor with W, and take it off again with T; you'll need a
free hand to be able to wear a shield, and likewise you can't wear two
pieces of armor that fit on the same part of the body.  Some armor is
magical, and has either a magical bonus (such as +1) to defending you,
or some other property; armor can also be inferior to normal, and have
a penalty (such as -1).  The manufacturer of armor is also relevant;
elves are good at making armor, and dwarves are even better, but
orcish armor tends to be rather low in quality.

Note that although anyone can wear armor, it hampers spellcasting;
metal armor in particular can mess up magic, and shields also make
spellcasting rather difficult.]],

Tutorial: FOOD

The %% character represents an edible item; note that just because you
can eat something, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea.  The
term 'comestibles' is used to represent food and other things that can
be eaten.  Eating is rather important; a character who doesn't eat for
too long will become hungry, grow weak, then eventually start fainting
from hunger and starve to death. (If you're getting hungry, this will
be shown near the bottom of the screen.) However, try not to eat when
'satiated'; you can choke to death, as well as starving.  You can eat
things (either in your inventory, or on the floor) with the e
command.  Fresh food tends to be considerably healthier than food
that's been left to rot; various types of food will spoil over time
and become dangerous, even if they were safe to eat when they first
appeared.

Note that killing monsters also often leaves a %% behind, which is the
monster's corpse.  Corpses can be eaten just the same way food can be
(as they tend to be heavy, eating from the floor is usually the best
option).  Not all are healthy, but some could give you special powers

Tutorial: SCROLLS

Scrolls (?) are magical items that store spells bound up on paper.  By
reading a scroll (using the r command), you can unleash the magic

unexpected magical effects can be rather bad for your health.  Anyone
can use a scroll, regardless of if they know any magic or not.

If you don't know what a scroll does, you'll see the scroll's label
rather than its function; within any given game, scrolls with the same
label do the same thing, but which label goes on which sort of scroll
can change from one game to the next. (You can use the \ command to
see the label/scroll mappings you've already discovered.) There may be
magical methods of determining what a given scroll does; in fact, one
of the spells commonly bound up in scroll form is a magical means of
determining the properties of an unknown item.

Magical scrolls are strictly single-use; because the scroll is being
used to capture a spell, the process of casting the spell also
destroys the scroll.]],

Tutorial: WANDS

Wands (/) are magical objects, which are generally designed to cast a
specific spell (depending on appearance; wand/appearance combinations
change from game to game).  They generally store enough magical energy
to cast that spell multiple times, but will eventually run out; if
somehow you discover the amount of energy in a wand, it will be shown
in the wand's description (e.g. (3:5) means that the wand has been
recharged 3 times, and can be used 5 more times before it next needs
to be recharged).  As wands are designed to cast spells by themselves,
you need not know magic yourself to be able to use them; just point
them in the desired direction and fire! You can use the z command to
'zap' a wand like this, to unleash its magic; note that you can only
aim in compass directions, upwards, downwards, and at yourself).

Other things you can do with wands include writing on the floor with
them (use the E command to do this), and breaking the wand with the a
command; note that breaking a wand often causes an enormous and rather
dangerous release of magical energy.  Wands also sometimes explode of
their own accord upon being recharged; the more a wand has been
recharged, the less likely it is to survive another recharging.]],

Tutorial: RINGS

Unlike wands, scrolls, and potions, rings (=) are a more permanent
sort of magical item; instead of being powered from an in-built
magical source (and therefore running out relatively quickly), most
are powered from your own body's food supply, causing you to get
hungry slightly more quickly (although some powerful rings need more
power than others).

You can put a ring on each ring finger, but only one on each hand; as
a result, you can wear up to two rings.  The put-on command, P, is used
to put on a ring; you can remove one using R.

Rings generally have an effect either on you, or on those around you;
note that not all effects are beneficial, and so you should be careful
when trying on rings whose effects you don't know. (The same way as
wands, scrolls, and potions work, rings with the same appearance will
always do the same thing in any given game, but which appearance has
which effect will differ from game to game.) You can use the \ command
to see which ring appearances you already know this game; note that

Tutorial: POTIONS

Potions (!) are magic in liquid form; being single-use magical items,
they work rather similarly to scrolls.  You can drink a potion using
the q ('quaff') command.  The main difference from scrolls is that as
potions are drunk not read, they affect the person who drank them.

Just as with most other magical items, you may not know what a potion
does upon encountering it; two potions which are the same colour will
do the same thing in any given game, but which colour of potion has
which effect will differ from one game to the next.  As some potions
can be very dangerous, be careful when quaffing potions of unknown
enchantment! Clear potions contain water; although water is normally
nonmagical, it might also be holy or unholy water, and because all
three look the same, it might be hard to tell them apart.

Other things you can do with potions include using #dip to dip items
into them, and using t to throw them at things. (Holy water is rather
effective as a thrown weapon against undead, for instance; but
splashing a potion against something normally gives a much weaker
magical effect than drinking it.)]],

Tutorial: TOOLS

The term 'tool' is used for a broad range of miscellaneous items,
shown with the ( symbol.  Although mostly nonmagical, some may have
magical powers; and even the ones that don't are nearly always useful
in some more mundane way.  Magical tools often, but not always, will
masquerade as a nonmagical tool, but there will often be some method
of telling the magical tool apart from the ordinary one.

You can use a tool using the a command; what using a tool does depends
on the tool.  Some tools can be used an unlimited number of times;
others will wear out, or run out of magic or other supplies. (For
instance, a lamp can run out of oil after a while.) There may be other
commands that make sense in relation to tools, based on their shape;
for instance, some tools are usable as weapons, and wielding them
using w so you can hit monsters with them makes sense.  Luckily, it's

Containers are a special subset of tools (and likewise, are

bags, boxes, chests and safes are all generally types of containers.
You can use containers to carry more than 52 stacks of items around
with you, by storing in the container; however, the weight of the
items inside will still be significant, and the weight of the
container itself can be too.

To put items into or take them out of a container in your inventory,
you can use the a command to use the container (just like with any
other tool); if the container is on the floor, you can likewise use
the #loot command to do the same thing.  Boxes and chests are often
locked or trapped; you could try using a lock-picking tool on them,
kicking them (using control-D from an adjacent square) in the hope of
breaking open the lock, or trying to force the lock with your wielded
weapon using the #force command.  If you're afraid of traps, the
command #untrap can be used to search for traps on the container

valuable gems are useful in increasing your score.

Things you can do with gems and rocks include throwing them (using the

characters learn spells.  Pretty much anyone can try to learn a spell

some of the book's magic to teach them the spell; but if the spell is
too difficult to learn, the attempt can backfire in a rather dangerous
manner.  As magic from the book is required, spellbooks will eventually
run out of it, fading and becoming unreadable in the process; and
similarly, you will not be able to retain the memory of how to cast a
spell forever.

Once you learn a spell, you can use the Z command to cast it (or + to
list the spells you know); some spells are easier to cast than others,
and unless your character is particularly good with magic, spells will
have a chance of going wrong when cast.  Armor also interferes with
spellcasting, and spells need a source of power; your magical energy
(Pw) is shown at the bottom of the screen, and is used to power spells

Tutorial: CALLING ITEMS

With all the items around with unknown purposes, it can be very useful

You are about to be given the chance to give a name to a certain
appearance of item (probably because one was destroyed and you saw the
effects of it); this will replace the appearance from now on, thus
reminding you of what you wrote.

An example: suppose you saw an orange potion break, and got a glimpse
of the sort of effects it had; the game might prompt you with "Call an
orange potion:".  This lets you rename orange potions; so, if for
instance you suspected that the potion was dangerous, you could write
"dangerous" at the prompt, and "orange potion" would from then on be
known as "potion called dangerous".  As two orange potions always have
the same effect, you'd know to avoid quaffing those potions in future.

If you have nothing to say about what you think the item in question
does, you can just leave the prompt blank, to leave the item with its
old name. (Also, note that you can use #name then n to call items
yourself, rather than waiting for the game to prompt you.)]],

Tutorial: ARTIFACTS

Some items are one of a kind! Artifacts are items with special powers,

made by the gods or some similarly powerful beings.

An artifact is identified by its proper name, which cannot be changed;
it will function perfectly well as the item it was based on (e.g. an
artifact longsword can do everything a longsword can), but will often
do other things as well; so for instance, artifact weapons often do
much more damage than a regular weapon would, and artifact tools
normally have one or more permanent magical effects.

Some artifacts tend to be rather picky about who uses them, however;
if you're not the sort of person the artifact wants as its owner, it
might damage you when you touch it, or even refuse to be used
altogether.  As always, then, it helps to be wary around artifacts of
unknown function. (Using the / command to ask about the artifact can
be a useful source of information, though; artifacts are sufficiently
famous that your character may have heard of them before ever even

Tutorial: RANDOM-APPEARANCE ITEMS

A large number of magical items have appearances that vary from game

one particular appearance of item does, you can use #name followed by
n to produce an alternative name for the appearance; e.g. you could
change "orange potion" to "potion called dangerous" if you decided
that all orange potions in the game were dangerous.

You might also get information about one particular item; for
instance, a curse on one orange potion does not mean that all others

still passes, so for instance, food will continue to spoil while you

up items that you left behind, and to run away from problems on deeper
levels, in favour of healing somewhere that's already been cleared
out.

Tutorial: MAGICAL POWER

It looks like you just used some of your magical power.  There are
several uses for it, although the main use is to cast spells.  The
amount of magical power you have is shown as Pw at the bottom of the
screen; the first number counts your current power reserves, and the
number in parentheses shows the maximum amount of power your body can
store at one time.  You regenerate magical power slowly over time;
nothing particularly bad happens if you run out, but if you don't have
enough power, you can't cast spells, or perform other actions that
need you to power them with personal magic.

The amount of power you have depends on your Wisdom ability (shown as
Wi: at the bottom of the screen); gaining more Wisdom will give you
more maximum power, and help you regenerate it faster.  There's another
ability relevant to magic; your Intelligence ability (shown as In: at
the bottom of the screen) also helps regenerate your magical power,
makes it easier to understand spellbooks you might find, and makes
your spells more powerful.]],

Tutorial: ALTERNATIVES TO MAGIC

It seems that your magical power has now run so low that you can't
cast any more spells, until it regenerates.  If your character relies
on magic, then you could be in trouble.

There are several things you could do here.  If there are no monsters
around, you might want to retreat to an area of the dungeon you've
already cleared out, to wait for your power to regenerate.  You might
also want to let your pet do the fighting for a while, if you have
one; although you probably don't want to expose it to too much danger.

Alternatively, you could try some non-magical combat yourself.  Even
spellcasting classes should practice with a weapon so that they can
fight in melee if they have to; thrown or projectile weapons are also
very useful for weakening monsters without exposing yourself to danger
in return.  It helps to get some practice with weapons against weaker
monsters, so that you aren't completely helpless against stronger
monsters when you run out of magic against them.]],

Tutorial: USING ARMOR

Your Armor Class (AC) has just decreased; as Armor Class measures how
vulnerable you are to attacks, this is a good thing.  Being better
armored reduces the chance that monsters will be able to hit you (as
armor helps to parry attacks); if you manage to get sufficiently well
armored, your body will be so well covered that the armor will be hard
to avoid, meaning that even when the attacks do connect, their damage
will be reduced.

Of course, there are always tradeoffs.  One potential problem with
wearing a lot of metal armor is that it makes spellcasting
difficult, although this is not a problem unless you intend to cast
spells.  Another potential issue is that the weight of armor can
encumber you, making you move more slowly and making you more
vulnerable as a result.  Shields take up a hand that you could be using
to hold a weapon.  Finally, there are several magical items that need
to be worn on parts of your body normally used for armor; so there may
eventually be a trade-off between armoring yourself well and gaining
magical benefits.  However, especially early on, the value of armor is
often large enough to outweigh all this.]],

Tutorial: EXPERIENCE

You just gained some experience! By far, killing monsters is the most
common way to gain experience, although there are a few weirder
methods (some experienced NetHack players have completed the game
without a single kill, although this is incredibly difficult to
achieve).

Accumulating experience is important, because it will eventually allow
you to level up, giving you a boost in maximum health and magical
power, making you better at spellcasting, and gaining you new special
abilities.  As a result, early on in the game you probably want to kill
more or less everything hostile, for the practice; later on, though,
some monsters will be better avoided than fought.

Pets can get experience too; it's getting the final blow in that gives
the experience, so if you're trying to keep a pet, you'll need to
think carefully about which of you should get the experience from any
given death.]],

Tutorial: HUNGER

You're getting hungry; now would be an especially good time to eat
something.  When you're hungry, your hunger status (such as "Hungry",
"Weak", or "Fainting") will be displayed at the bottom of the screen;
merely being hungry isn't disastrous, but becoming too hungry can kill
you easily, either directly by starving to death, or indirectly by
making you too weak to defend yourself.

Therefore, you'd better try to find something to eat.  The corpses of
monsters are often edible; although many sorts of food spoil over
time, so fresh corpses are more likely to be healthy.  An important
skill is learning what's safe to eat, and what will kill you.

You can also try eating food from your inventory; you can use I to see
which "comestibles" you're carrying around.  Some sorts of food are
best saved for when you can't find any monsters around to kill and
eat; food designed for people to eat is often especially nutritious
and can get you out of starvation trouble quickly.

Use the e command to eat food, from the floor or your inventory.]],

Tutorial: SATIATION

There's an opposite problem to hunger; eating too much can make you
satiated, which can be bad for your health.  When satiated, eating yet
more food could be a bad idea, as there's a limit to how much your
stomach can hold; you might end up choking to death!

If there are things you really feel you need to eat, you could try
burning off some of those calories first; several sorts of magic
(spells, rings, and amulets) power themselves from your body's food
supplies, so you could try using those.  You might also find other
calorie-burning actions as the game progresses.

Mostly, though, the easiest way to burn off the calories will simply
be to continue adventuring until you naturally end up hungry again;
after all, food doesn't last forever.]],

Tutorial: STATUS

Status effects are effects like confusion or blindness that affect
your character negatively, making it harder to act correctly.  They're
displayed at the bottom of the screen.  Some status effects can kill
you directly, as you die from illness or food poisoning; others are
dangerous more indirectly, as they impair your senses or your actions,
making it considerably easier for monsters to kill you.  Therefore,
it's probably advisable to try to cure the status.

If the status is not fatal in itself, you may be able to cure yourself
simply by waiting somewhere where there are fewer monsters, trying to
survive until your body recovers; but this will just make things worse
in some cases.  Your main alternatives are to try to find an item or
spell that will cure you.  Also, although it's too late now, it's often
possible to avoid the status in the first place; for instance, it's
advisable not to eat monster corpses that will give you status
effects (you can find out which these are by experimenting over the
course of several games).  Asking for divine intervention with #pray
may save your life, too, in the most serious cases; but this should be
treated as a last resort, as deities dislike being bothered too much.]],

Tutorial: ENHANCING SKILLS

Practicing a particular area of fighting, weaponry, or magic, will
allow you to get better in it, to some extent.  Your character now has
enough practice to be able to 'enhance' a skill, becoming better at
it; to do this, use the #enhance command.

Note that the total amount of skill enhancement you can manage depends
on your experience level; as a result, if you somehow get enough
practice to enhance a skill you aren't planning to use, it may be a
good idea to decide not to enhance that skill, so as to save your
skill slots for some other skill.  Likewise, if there's some skill you
are planning to use in the future, it may be worth practicing it now,
so that it's enhanced ready for you to be able to use it.

Only skills listed in the #enhance list are enhanceable at all; most
characters will have some skills they'll never be able to get good
at.  Similarly, the maximum competence you can gain in a skill (basic,
skilled, expert, master, grand master) will depend on your class; for
instance, a competence of 'master' or better can only be achieved in
martial arts or unarmed combat, and even then, only by some classes.]],

possible that some things you took for granted, such as the ability to
open doors, are not possible in this form.

Some monsters have a special attack or ability; if you do, you'll have
been told what it was, and you can use the #monster command to use it.

might also be using it to try to communicate with you.

You can write on the floor yourself, too, using the E command.  You can
write in the dust with your fingers using E-, but such writing tends

You seem to be in serious trouble! Sometimes, you end up badly

As long as you've been careful not to do anything too sacrilegious,
and have been advancing the cause of your religion (killing hostile
monsters is generally a good way to do this), calling upon your
%G (%d) may help.

Prayer is accomplished by the #pray command; although you can't rely
on divine intervention too often, it can get you out of problematic
situations reliably, if you don't do it so much that your %G
becomes annoyed.  Care is needed; an annoyed deity can do all sorts of
drastic things to you! If you do annoy your %G by mistake, or
you want to please them so you can pray more quickly, you might want
to find an altar dedicated to them and use #offer to sacrifice a
recently killed monster; as long as the offer isn't offensive, you
can gain standing in the eye of your %G this way.]],

Tutorial: ENCUMBERANCE

One problem that every adventurer seems to face is the problem of
hauling all that treasure around.  Your Strength ability (shown as St:
at the bottom of the screen) is important in influencing how much you
can carry (and also has a large effect on the effectiveness of your
fighting in melee); you generally want to be strong to be able to
carry a lot of gear. (Constitution (Co:) is also relevant.)

The more you have on you, the more and more burdened you become; if
you're having trouble carrying your equipment, the bottom of the
screen will show your encumberance status, ranging from "Burdened"
through "Stressed", "Strained", and "Overtaxed" up to "Overloaded".
The more encumbered you are, the slower you'll perform all actions,
and the more often you'll need to eat; being slower means that the
movements of monsters will seem faster by comparison, which could be
rather dangerous for you.  As a result, try discarding items to save
weight; you can come back to them later.

You can use the d command in order to drop an unwanted item; dropping
several items now is probably a good idea.]],

Tutorial: CURSES

Some items bear curses, which make them considerably worse; you seem
to have come across such an item.  Curses are generally not incredibly
bad; mostly they make an object less effective than it would be
otherwise, although sometimes they have other negative or detrimental
effects.  Cursed equipment also tends not to want to be unequipped; you
normally need to find some magical method of lifting the curse to be
able to get rid of it.

There's an opposite to curses, too; an item can be blessed, which will
make it more beneficial (or in the case of dangerous items, less
bad).  For instance, demons are injured more badly by blessed weapons.
A blessing or a curse on water is what makes it holy or unholy water,
respectively.

Your inventory will list a blessing or a curse on any objects for
which you find out that information; if you know for certain an object
is neither blessed nor cursed, it'll be marked as "uncursed".  There

Tutorial: MAIL

You've got mail! If someone sends you a message, a mail daemon will
turn up and give it to you; it'll appear in the form of a scroll, and
reading the scroll will allow you to check what the message was.  The
form of the message will depend on where and how you're playing; if
you're on your own computer, then the scroll will normally be a
response to the receipt of email, in which case you can read the
scroll to read the email; but when playing on a public NetHack server,
the mail will probably be related to your game, sent by someone
watching.  In this case, you can effectively send a reply by pressing
#, then space, then typing in your message and leaving it on the
screen for a while; whoever's watching your game (and sent the mail)

Tutorial: SPELLCASTING AND ARMOR

Spellcasting is always a matter of trade-offs; using up magical power,
and burning calories, are things that cannot be kept up forever, so
you generally need to think carefully about when to use spells and
when to use more mundane methods.  There's another issue that causes
problems when spellcasting, though; whether to wear armor.

Metal armor tends to block magic, and shields get in the way of the
complex hand motions needed to cast a spell properly; as a result,
wearing metal armor or a shield can really mess up your chances of
casting spells correctly.  You can use + to see your spell failure
chances, to help you make an informed decision about whether the
armor is worth it or not.  If you're particularly good at magic, it's
possible that easier spells will be 100%% successful despite the
armor; in this case, you might want to confine yourself to low-level
spells, and wear the armor for extra protection.  Later in the game,
though, you'll probably want to cast higher-level spells, and may have
to ditch the armor (or change to non-metallic armor) as a result.  If
you aren't that good at magic, then it may also be worth considering
just ignoring magic altogether and using whatever armor you can find.]],

Tutorial: WEAPON CHOICE

The weapon you're currently wielding isn't one that your character is
particularly good with.  Choosing an appropriate weapon can be quite a
problem, especially if none of the weapons that you've learnt so far

You can use the #enhance command to see which weapons your character
knows how to use, and which ones you can learn; any skill that's

it's one that it's possible to learn, and then practice it against
weaker enemies; with a weapon you aren't trained in, you're going to
find it hard to hit and to deal significant damage, until you've had a
lot of practice. (It may be worth going higher up in the dungeon to
find weaker opponents to train against, as a result.)

Alternatively, you could just switch back to a weapon you already know
how to use; most characters will be able to become highly proficient

It seems that you've been swallowed by a monster! Various monsters

you're going to have to fight your way out from the inside.

When engulfed, all 8 compass directions count as attacks against the
monster; so for instance, moving in any direction will melee it.  You
can use spells inside a monster, too (casting in any direction); and
likewise, zapping wands at it may be a useful way to escape.

Generally speaking, you need to get out before the monster does
whatever unpleasant things it's planning to do to you; being digested
is a rather final end to a game, and the insides of most monsters will

enter "explore mode", as it's called, type X whilst playing a game;

A dungeon may seem a rather strange place to set up a shop, but some
hardy shopkeepers attempt to make the best of the commercial potential
that a dungeon has to offer.  You can use your money to buy the items
on offer in the shop; or if you have items that the shopkeeper is
interested in, you can try selling them.

Apart from the square just inside the door (which doesn't count as

you can pick them up to examine them, but the shopkeeper will get
annoyed if you damage them.  Once you're holding an item you want to

Similarly, you can drop items inside the shop, and if the shopkeeper
is interested he or she will offer to pay for them (if you decline the
offer, you can simply pick them back up again).

Note that leaving autopickup on in a shop is generally a bad idea; you

but paying first is a prudent strategy, as shopkeepers are used to
having to take their produce back by force.)

There are three commands that you may find useful in relation to
unpaid items; you can use p to pay for an item, $ to check how much
money you owe the shopkeeper (or vice versa), and d to drop the item
if you decide you don't want it after all.

Note that as an alternative to picking up items to find out how much
they cost, you can use the #chat command while standing on the item,

special; eventually, if you explore right the way to the bottom of the
