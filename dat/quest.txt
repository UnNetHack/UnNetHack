%Cc Arc 00001
You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
appear to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It looks
as if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
been under siege.

All of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
the entrance.

Strange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
%E
%Cp Arc 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Arc 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Arc 00005
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00006
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00007
"Did you see the artifact %l brought back from the last dig?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00008
"So what species do *you* think we evolved from?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00009
"So you're %ls prize pupil!  I don't know what he sees in you."
%E
%Cp Arc 00010
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00011
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00012
"I guess you are guaranteed to make full professor now."
%E
%Cp Arc 00013
"So, what was worse, %n or your entrance exams?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00014
"%oC is impressive, but nothing like the bones I dug up!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00015
"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
my most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
most difficult task of your career."
%E
%Cp Arc 00016
"Again, %p, you stand before me.
Let me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
%E
%Cp Arc 00017
"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00018
"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!

"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00019
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
taught you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00020
"%pC!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
results lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!

"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
back only when you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Arc 00021
"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
stolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
the university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.

"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
you will find %n.

"You must then defeat %n and return %o
to me.

"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
close this college.

"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Arc 00025
"Beware, for %n is powerful and cunning."
%E
%Cp Arc 00026
"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
many traps."
%E
%Cp Arc 00027
"A %nt may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
%E
%Cp Arc 00028
"Call upon %d when you encounter %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00029
"You must destroy %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
%E
%Cp Arc 00030
"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
can destroy %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00031
"Go forth with the blessings of %d."
%E
%Cp Arc 00032
"I will have my %gP watch for your return."
%E
%Cp Arc 00033
"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
%E
%Cp Arc 00034
"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
%E
%Cc Arc 00035
A plain opens before you.  Beyond the plain lies a foreboding edifice.

You have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
%i.
%E
%Cp Arc 00036
Once again, you are near the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Arc 00040
A strange feeling washes over you, and you think back to things you
learned during the many lectures of %l.

You realize the feeling must be the presence of %o.
%E
%Cp Arc 00041
The familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
%E
%Cc Arc 00050
"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.

"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
%E
%Cc Arc 00051
"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.

"You shall never recover %o.

"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
%E
%Cp Arc 00052
"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
upon your entrails!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00060
"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Arc 00061
"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00062
"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
%E
%Cp Arc 00063
"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
falter!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00064
"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00065
"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
%E
%Cp Arc 00066
"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00067
"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00068
"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Arc 00069
"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
%E
%Cc Arc 00070
The power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
as if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
you know you must return %o to %l.
%E
%Cp Arc 00080
The body of %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
%E
%Cc Arc 00081
%lC touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
then smiles at you and says:

"Well done, %p.  You have defeated %n and
recovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
here.

Please take %o with you.  You, %p, can
guard it now far better than I.

May the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
%E
# assumes Orb of Detection (glass object)
%Cc Arc 00082
"Careful, %p!  %oC might break, and that would be
a tragic loss.  You are its keeper now, and the time has come to
resume your search for the Amulet.  %Z await your
return through the magic portal that brought you here."
%E
%Cc Arc 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00091
"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
the Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
final adventure.

"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the astral plane.
There you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
Amulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.

"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."
%E

#	Barbarian

%Cc Bar 00001
Warily you scan your surroundings, all of your senses alert for signs
of possible danger.  Off in the distance, you can %x the familiar shapes
of %H.

But why, you think, should %l be there?

Suddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect the aura of
evil magic in the air.

Without thought, you ready your weapon, and mutter under your breath:

    "By %d, there will be blood spilt today."
%E
%Cp Bar 00002
Once again, you near %H.  You know that %l
will be waiting.
%E
%Cp Bar 00003
Again, and you think possibly for the last time, you approach
%H.
%E
%Cp Bar 00005
"The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00006
"Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00007
"There has been little treasure to loot, since the horde arrived."
%E
%Cp Bar 00008
"The horde is mighty in numbers, but they have little courage."
%E
%Cp Bar 00009
"%lC is a strange one, but he has helped defend us."
%E
%Cp Bar 00010
"The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00011
"Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00012
"Times will be good again, now that the horde is vanquished."
%E
%Cp Bar 00013
"You have brought our clan much honor in defeating %n."
%E
%Cp Bar 00014
"You will be a worthy successor to %l."
%E
%Cc Bar 00015
"Ah, %p.  You have returned at last.  The world is in dire
need of your help.  There is a great quest you must undertake.

"But first, I must see if you are ready to take on such a challenge."
%E
%Cp Bar 00016
"%p, you are back.  Are you ready now for the challenge?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00017
"Again, you stand before me, %p.  Surely you have prepared yourself."
%E
%Cc Bar 00018
"Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, %p.  You will never attain
the glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has
closed this future to you.

"I will protect these people as best I can, but soon %n will overcome
me and destroy all who once called you %s.  Now begone!"
%E
%Cc Bar 00019
"%p, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face
%n.  Only %Ra with the help of %d could ever hope to
defeat him."
%E
%Cc Bar 00020
"%pC!  You have wandered from the path of the %a!
If you attempt to overcome %n in this state, he will surely
enslave your soul.  Your only hope, and ours, lies in your purification.
Go forth, and return when you feel ready."
%E
%Cc Bar 00021
"The world is in great need of your assistance, %p.

"About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
as %n, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands
about him.

"At about the same time, these people you once rode with `liberated' a
potent magical talisman, %o, from a Turanian caravan.

"%nC and his Black Horde swept down upon %i and defeated
the people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken
%o, and seeks to bend it to his will.  I detected the
subtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people.
Then I sent forth a summons for you.

"If %n can bend %o to his will, he will become
almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of
men across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
and with %d behind you, you alone can defeat %n.

"You must go to %i.  From there, you can track down
%n, defeat him, and return %o to us.  Only
then will the world be safe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00025
"%nC is strong in the dark arts, but not immune to cold steel."
%E
%Cp Bar 00026
"Remember that %n is a great sorcerer.  He lived in the time
of Atlantis."
%E
%Cp Bar 00027
"If you fail, %p, I will not be able to protect these people long."
%E
%Cp Bar 00028
"To enter %i, you must be very stealthy.  The horde will be on
guard."
%E
%Cp Bar 00029
"Call upon %d in your time of need."
%E
%Cp Bar 00030
"May %d protect you, and guide your steps."
%E
%Cp Bar 00031
"If you can lay hands upon %o, carry it for good fortune."
%E
%Cp Bar 00032
"I cannot stand against %ns sorcery.  But %d will help you."
%E
%Cp Bar 00033
"Do not fear %n.  I know you can defeat him."
%E
%Cp Bar 00034
"You have a great road to travel, %p, but only after you defeat
%n."
%E
%Cc Bar 00035
The scent of water comes to you in the desert breeze.  You know that
you have located %i.
%E
%Cp Bar 00036
Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate %i.
%E
%Cc Bar 00040
The hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the
very air around you.  You fight down a primordial panic that seeks to
make you turn and run.  This is surely the lair of %n.
%E
%Cp Bar 00041
Yet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.
%E
%Cc Bar 00050
"So.  This is what that second rate sorcerer %l sends to do his bidding.
I have slain many before you.  You shall give me little sport.

"Prepare to die, %c."
%E
%Cp Bar 00051
"I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."
%E
%Cp Bar 00052
"You return yet again, %c!  Are you prepared for death now?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00053
"I shall have %o back, you pitiful excuse for %ca.
And your life as well."
%E
%Cp Bar 00060
"My pets will dine on your carcass tonight!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00061
"You are a sorry excuse for %ra."
%E
%Cp Bar 00062
"Run while you can, %c.  My next spell will be your last."
%E
%Cp Bar 00063
"I shall use your very skin to bind my next grimoire."
%E
%Cp Bar 00064
"%d cannot protect you now.  Here, you die."
%E
%Cp Bar 00065
"Your %a nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Bar 00066
"Come, %c.  I shall kill you, then unleash the horde on your tribe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00067
"Once you are dead, my horde shall finish off %l, and your tribe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00068
"Fight, %c, or are you afraid of the mighty %n?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00069
"You have failed, %c.  Now, my victory is complete."
%E
%Cc Bar 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel the power of it
flowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more places
at once, even though you are holding it.
%E
%Cc Bar 00080
%nC falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then his
body fades slowly, seemingly dispersing into the air around you.  You
slowly become aware that the overpowering aura of magic in the air has
begun to fade.
%E
%Cc Bar 00081
When %l sees %o, he smiles, and says:

    Well done, %p.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
    What, now, should be done with %o?

    These people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
    other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as %n did.

    Take %o with you, %p.  It will guard you in
    your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a
    quest far greater than you realize.

    Remember me, %p, and return when you have triumphed.  I
    will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
    time comes.
%E
%Cc Bar 00082
%l gazes reverently at %o, then back at you.

"You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
for the Amulet.  %Z await your return through the
magic portal which brought you here."
%E
%Cp Bar 00090
"Tell us, %p, have you fared well on your great quest?"
%E
%Cc Bar 00091
"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly
succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
of Yendor!

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will
    stand by %d as champion of all %cP for eternity.

"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."
%E

%Cc Cav 00001
You descend through a barely familiar stairwell that you remember
%l showing you when you embarked upon your vision quest.

You arrive back at %H, but something seems
wrong here.  The usual smoke and glowing light of the fires of the
outer caves are absent, and an uneasy quiet fills the damp air.
%E
%Cp Cav 00002
Once again, you arrive back at %H.
%E
%Cp Cav 00003
For some reason, you think that this may be the last time you will
enter %H.
%E
%Cp Cav 00005
"We have not been able to gather as much food since the Giants sealed
off our access to the outer world."
%E
%Cp Cav 00006
"Since %n sent her minions, we have been constantly fighting."
%E
%Cp Cav 00007
"I have heard your vision quest was successful.  Is this so?"
%E
%Cp Cav 00008
"So, tell me, %p, how have you fared?"
%E
%Cp Cav 00009
"%lC grows old.  We know not who will guide us after he ascends."
%E
%Cp Cav 00010
"The rains have returned and the land grows lush again."
%E
%Cp Cav 00011
"Peace has returned, give thanks to %d!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00012
"Welcome back!  Did you find %o?"
%E
%Cp Cav 00013
"So, %p, tell us the story of your fight with %n."
%E
%Cp Cav 00014
"%lC grows old.  Perhaps you will guide us after he ascends."
%E
%Cc Cav 00015
"You have returned from your vision quest, %p.  Thank %d.

"We are in dire need of your help, my %S.

"But first, I must see if you are yet capable of the quest I would
ask you to undertake."
%E
%Cp Cav 00016
"Again, you return to us, %p.  Let me see if you are ready now."
%E
%Cp Cav 00017
"Ah, %p.  Are you finally ready?"
%E
%Cc Cav 00018
"%pC!  You have sealed our fate.  You seem unable to reform yourself,
so I must select another to take your place.

"Begone from %H!  You have betrayed us by choosing
the path of the %C over the true path of the %L.

"You no longer live in our eyes."
%E
%Cc Cav 00019
"Alas, %p, you are as yet too inexperienced to embark upon such
a difficult quest as that I propose to give you.

"%rA could not possibly survive the rigors demanded to find
%i, never mind to confront %n herself.

"Adventure some more, and you will learn the skills you will require.
%d decrees it."
%E
%Cc Cav 00020
"%pC!  You have deviated from my teachings.  You no longer follow
the path of the %a as you should.  I banish you from these caves, to
go forth and purify yourself.  Then, you might be able to accomplish this
quest."
%E
%Cc Cav 00021
"You are indeed ready now, %p.  I shall tell you a tale of
great suffering among your people:

"Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the caves were invaded by
the creatures sent against us by %n.

"She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
have harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the
minions of %n managed to steal %o.
They took it to %i and there, none of our
%g warriors have been able to go.

"You must find %i, and within it wrest
%o from %n.  She guards it as
jealously as she guards all treasures she attains.  But with it,
we can make our caves safe once more.

"Please, %p, recover %o for us, and return it here."
%E
%Cp Cav 00025
"%nC is immune to her own breath weapons.
You should use magic upon her that she does not use herself."
%E
%Cp Cav 00026
"When you encounter %n, call upon %d for assistance."
%E
%Cp Cav 00027
"There will be nowhere to hide inside %ns inner sanctum."
%E
%Cp Cav 00028
"Your best chance with %n will be to keep moving."
%E
%Cp Cav 00029
"Do not be distracted by the great treasures in %ns lair.
Concentrate on %o."
%E
%Cp Cav 00030
"%oC is the only object that %n truly fears."
%E
%Cp Cav 00031
"Do not be fooled by %ns size.  She is fast, and it is
rumored that she uses magic."
%E
%Cp Cav 00032
"I would send a party of %gP with you, but we will need all
of our strength to defend ourselves."
%E
%Cp Cav 00033
"Remember, be %a at all times.  This is your strength."
%E
%Cp Cav 00034
"If only we had an amulet of reflection, this would not have happened."
%E
%Cc Cav 00035
You %x many large claw marks on the ground.  The tunnels ahead
of you are larger than most of those in any cave complex you have
ever been in before.

Your nose detects the smell of carrion from within, and bones litter
the sides of the tunnels.
%E
%Cp Cav 00036
Once again, you approach %i.
%E
%Cc Cav 00040
You find yourself in a large cavern, with neatly polished walls, that
nevertheless show signs of being scorched by fire.

Bones litter the floor, and there are objects scattered everywhere.
The air is close with the stench of sulphurous fumes.

%nC is clearly visible, but she seems to be asleep.
%E
%Cp Cav 00041
Once again, you find yourself in the lair of %n.
%E
%Cc Cav 00050
"So, follower of %l, you seek to invade the lair of %n.
Only my meals are allowed down here.  Prepare to be eaten!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00051
"So, again you face me, %c.  No one has ever before escaped me.
Now I shall kill you."
%E
%Cp Cav 00052
"You are getting annoying, %c.  Prepare to die."
%E
%Cp Cav 00053
"I'll have %o from you, %c.  You shall die."
%E
%Cp Cav 00060
"You are weak, %c.  No challenge for the Mother of all Dragons."
%E
%Cp Cav 00061
"I grow hungry, %r.  You look like a nice appetizer!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00062
"Join me for lunch?  You're the main course, %c."
%E
%Cp Cav 00063
"With %o, I am invincible!  You cannot succeed."
%E
%Cp Cav 00064
"Your mentor, %l has failed.  You are nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Cav 00065
"You shall die here, %c.  %rA cannot hope to defeat me."
%E
%Cp Cav 00066
"You, a mere %r challenge the might of %n?  Hah!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00067
"I am the Mother of all Dragons!  You cannot hope to defeat me."
%E
%Cp Cav 00068
"My claws are sharp now.  I shall rip you to shreds!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00069
"%d has deserted you, %c.  This is my domain."
%E
%Cc Cav 00070

What sorcery has brought you back to %H?  The smell

powers that used to practice here.

No rhizotomists are tending the materia medica gardens, and where are the

    A short while ago, the dreaded %nt was fooled by the gods
    into thinking that he could use %o to find a

    He has exhausted his own supply of healthy people and now he seeks to
    extend his influence into our world.  You must recover from him

With that %n dies.

    Now that we have been replenished we can defeat this plague.  You must

"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
tell you of what has transpired:

"At one of the Great Festivals a short time ago, %n and a legion
of undead invaded %H.  Many %gP were killed, including
the one carrying %o.

"As a final act of vengefulness, %n desecrated the altar here.
Without it, we could not mount a counter-attack.  Now, there are
barely enough %gP left to keep the undead at bay.

"We need you to find %i, then, from there, travel
to %ns lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n and return
%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
undead that befoul the land.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."

"Call upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
%E
%Cp Pri 00032
"The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."

"Wear %o.  It will assist you against the undead."
%E
%Cc Pri 00035
You stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
that seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
undead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.

You remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by

%E
%Cp Pri 00036
Again, you stand before %i.

%Cc Pri 00040
The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
of tortured souls assault your psyche.

Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
%E
%Cp Pri 00041
Again, you have invaded %ns domain.
%E
%Cc Pri 00050
"Ah, so %lC has sent another %g to retrieve

You feel a wrenching shift in the ether as %ns body dissolves

Suddenly, a voice booms out:

    Thou hast defeated the least of my minions, %r.

    As for thee, %n, I shall deal with thy failure
    at my leisure.

You then hear the voice of %n, screaming in terror...

"You are indeed ready, %p.  I shall tell you what has transpired,
and why we so desperately need your help:

"A short time ago, the mountain centaurs to the east invaded
and enslaved the plains centaurs in this area.  The local
leader is now only a figurehead, and serves %n.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
hostile centaurs, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
headed by %n himself, managed to breach the grove and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
underground cavern of %n.  He has always coveted
%o, and will surely keep it.

"Recover %o for us, %p!  Only then will %d be safe."
%E
%Cp Ran 00025
"It is rumored that the Forest and Mountain Centaurs have resolved
their ancient feud and now band together against us."

%Cp Ran 00027
"Use %o, when you find it.  It will help you survive
to reach us."
%E
%Cp Ran 00028
"Remember, let %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Ran 00029
"Call upon %d when you face %n.
The very act of doing so will infuriate him, and give you advantage."
%E
%Cp Ran 00030
"%n and his kind have always hated us."
%E
%Cp Ran 00031
"We cannot hold the grove much longer, %p.  Hurry!"
%E
%Cp Ran 00032
"To infiltrate %i, you must be very stealthy."
%E
%Cp Ran 00033
"Remember that %n is a braggart.  Trust not what he says."
%E
%Cp Ran 00034
"You can triumph, %p, if you trust in %d."
%E
%Cc Ran 00035
This must be %i.

You are in a cave built of many different rooms, all interconnected
by tunnels.  Your quest is to find and shoot the evil wumpus that
resides elsewhere in the cave without running into any bottomless
pits or using up your limited supply of arrows.  Good luck.

You are in room 9 of the cave.  There are tunnels to rooms
5, 8, and 10.

    the amulet and the karma of %o are joined
    as the seasons join to make a year.

    Because you have shown such fidelity, the emperor requests
    that you take leave of other obligations and continue on the
    road that fate has set your feet upon.  I would consider it
    an honor if you would allow me to watch your household until
    you return with the amulet.

However, things are not the same as when you were last here.  Mists and

Tutorial: WELCOME

Welcome to NetHack! These tutorial messages will help to teach you how
to play the game. (Use ? for more in-depth help on the game.)

The screen generally contains (non-tutorial) messages at the top (if
any), information about your character at the bottom (this will be
explained later), and a map in between. Each symbol on the screen
represents something; you are the @ sign (which might be hidden behind
this message at the moment, but you'll be able to see it most of the
time), and the screen will show what you can see and what you can
remember. In general, letters (and a few symbols like ' : ; & and @)
represent creatures (which could be friendly or hostile); and most
punctuation marks represent either dungeon features (such as - and |
for walls and doors, # for corridors, and . for the floor), or items
(such as $ for gold). Eventually you'll know the symbols off by heart;
while you're learning, you can press /n for a reminder of what any
symbol means, or ; to find out what any object on the map is.

Let's start by looking around a bit; close this message with the
spacebar, then press ; so that you can look at nearby objects.

Tutorial: CURSOR MOVEMENT (with the number pad)

In order to specify what you want to look at, you have to be able to
move the cursor. You may be used to thinking of four directions in
which an object can move; but NetHack has eleven:

north-west north north-east          upwards
       7     8     9                    <

           here
  west 4     .     6 east
          at self

       1     2     3                    >
south-west south south-east         downwards

In the case of looking at an object on-screen, we can only look
sideways, not upwards or downwards, so only bother with the numbers
for the time being. Use the numbers in order to move the cursor over
the location to look at; then press the . button to select it. If you
aren't sure what to look at, look at a monster (a letter on the map).
%E
%Cm - 00203
Tutorial: CURSOR MOVEMENT (with vi-style controls)

In order to specify what you want to look at, you have to be able to
move the cursor. You may be used to thinking of four directions in
which an object can move; but NetHack has eleven:

north-west north north-east      upwards     Note: for orthogonal
       y     k     u                <        movement, hjkl are in a
                                             row on a QWERTY keyboard;
           here                              j's descender goes down,
  west h     .     l east                    k's ascender goes up. The
          at self                            diagonals are the letters
                                             diagonally adjacent to h,
       b     j     n                >        in the corresponding
south-west south south-east     downwards    directions.

In the case of looking at an object on-screen, you can only look

aren't sure what to look at, look at a monster (a letter on the map).

%Cm - 00210
Tutorial: PETS

The Mazes of Menace may be a dangerous and hostile place to adventure
in, but luckily, you don't have to do it alone. You start each game
with a tame kitten (f), little dog (d), or pony (u); they will follow
you around the dungeon, and fight monsters with you. Your pet can
mostly take care of itself; for instance, it will try to feed itself
with the corpses of enemy monsters to prevent itself becoming hungry,
and back out of fights it thinks it will lose. Over time, as the pet
gets more practice, it will get better at combat, and may grow into a
larger animal; and to start with, your pet may well be better at
combat than you are; a useful friend for an inexperienced character.

Note that your pet can't follow you everywhere; if you go up or down
stairs, your pet will only be able to follow if it's next to you at
the time, and will otherwise become stranded and may go wild. In
general, if you want to make sure you keep track of your pet, keep it
close by whenever you can.

If you aren't sure what to do next, use the cursor movement keys to
walk around, or use ; to look at more things around you.
%E
%Cm - 00211
Tutorial: MONSTERS

That's a hostile monster, one of the huge number of threats facing you
in the Mazes of Menace. Note that monsters are only displayed onscreen
if your character can see them; therefore, it can be important to try
to get the best view of what's ahead that you can, and be especially
wary in dark corridors!

There are several ways to deal with enemy monsters. Although often you
can simply run away, that can leave you backed into a corner, and some
monsters will be able to outrun you; even so, that option is often
worth considering. More usually, you'll want to kill the monster;
common methods are fighting it hand-to-hand ('in melee'), using
missiles, and casting spells.

To attack a monster in melee, simply walk into it, and you'll hit the
monster with whatever you're holding in your hands. Movement in the
dungeon is done the same way as moving the cursor; you can even move
diagonally like this. (Melee should be good enough to beat most early
monsters, although many characters will have a better method of
fighting.) Try fighting that monster now!
%E
%Cm - 00212
Tutorial: PEACEFUL MONSTERS AND ALIGNMENT

Not all monsters are out to kill everyone they meet; many monsters will
have more sense than that. Many monsters can be very dangerous when
angered; so it's often a good idea to leave peaceful monsters be. If a
peaceful monster is blocking your way, try waiting a few turns (press
the . key in order to wait a turn) to see if they move out of the way.

Amongst the factors that determine how a monster will react to you,
one of the most important is alignment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic);
monsters which have a similar outlook on life to you are more likely
to be non-aggressive. You can see your alignment in the status area
near the bottom of the screen, or by pressing control-X; this also
lets you know about the connected area of religion (sharing an
alignment implies sharing a god). Note that although lawful behaviour
tends to be good, and evil behaviour tends to be chaotic, legal and
ethical do not always coincide.

One useful form of interaction with certain peaceful and tame monsters
is to chat to them using #chat; you'll see the outcome of the
conversation at the top of the screen.
%E
# Technically speaking, finding invisible monsters using s is a
# spoiler; but again, it's relatively obvious.
%Cm - 00213
Tutorial: INVISIBLE MONSTERS

It looks like there's something around here you can't see! This might
be because the monster is invisible, or you might not be able to see
it for some other reason. Either way, fighting it could be difficult.

Unlike all other letters, the letter I on the map is special; instead
of indicating a monster you can see right now, it indicates where an
invisible monster was the last time you determined its location. You
can fight an I the same way you fight any other monster (e.g. you can
fight it in melee by walking into it), but the monster might have
moved since you discovered where it was, in which case your attack
will miss altogether.

If you think an invisible monster has moved, you can use the F and m
commands; F followed by a movement direction attacks an adjacent
square even if there's apparently nothing there, and m followed by a
movement direction walks onto a square even if you remember a monster
was there. Searching around you by pressing s may also be helpful;
it's considerably easier to feel an invisible monster next to you than
it is to find a secret door or trap.
%E
%Cm - 00230
Tutorial: DOORS AND DOORWAYS

Closed doors are represented by the + character; open doors are by
default represented by a | or - character, perpendicular to the wall
that they're on (although your options may be set to show it in a more
stylish way, to avoid it getting muddled with a wall). A closed door
is a rather obvious obstacle to any adventurer, but there are several
ways to deal with one. Probably the most obvious method of getting
past a door is to try to open it; to do that, stand adjacent to the
door, press o, and specify the direction that the door is in. Some
doors are locked; in this case, you'll have to either pick the lock
(by using the a command to use a lock-picking tool, if you have one),
or kick the door down using control-D.

Open doors are less obviously obstacles, but they still hamper
movement to some extent, as it's impossible to move diagonally into or
out of an open doorway; you have to approach it straight. You can also
close an open door by pressing c when standing adjacent to it; because
most monsters don't know how to, or physically can't, open doors, this

Tutorial: CORRIDORS AND LIGHTING

Up here near the top of the dungeon, the vast majority of rooms are
going to be well-lit; you can see anything that's on a lit square,
unless there's a wall or other equally solid object in the way,
blocking your view. When a square does go out of sight, your character
won't be able to see it, but your memory of it will continue to be
displayed on the map; monsters shown on the square will be removed,
because monsters tend to walk around, but any items or dungeon
features on the square will continue to be displayed (and you can use
; to find out what they were, if you've forgotten).

Corridors are generally represented by the # symbol (your options may
be set to use a slightly more artistic representation); the solid rock
that borders them is just displayed with blank space. Corridors are
generally dark; unless you illuminate them yourself somehow, you'll
only be able to fully see the squares adjacent to you (as well as any
lit squares in the distance, if there's no solid object in the way).
Take extra care in corridors; you might suddenly end up next to a
monster you couldn't previously see, due to being too far away!

Tutorial: SECRET DOORS AND CORRIDORS

Not everything in these dungeons is quite as it seems. Amongst dungeon
designers, it's a common habit to hide some of the connections between
one room and the next, and this dungeon is no exception.

A secret door or corridor just looks like normal rock or a normal
wall, until it's discovered; the usual way to discover one is to
carefully search the area around it. If you think you're standing
adjacent to such a secret passage, you can use the s command to start
looking for it; however, it can take a beginning character quite a lot
of searching to find anything even if there is something there, so
it's often necessary to press s several times. (And of course, all
that searching will be in vain if there is in fact nothing there!)
Good places to search are in apparent dead-ends, and similar
situations where it seems likely that there's a way forward, but you
can't see what it is.

This is a good place to try searching, because there is a door or
corridor hidden adjacent to your current location; try pressing s
until you find it, although note that searching takes time.
%E
# The guidebook's basically silent on this. So, this is my attempt
# to describe what happens without spoiling anything too important.
%Cm - 00233
Tutorial: WATER

Water (by default represented as a } character, but this is often
customized to show as something else) is yet another of the hazards
you may end up facing. Generally speaking, a typical adventurer won't
be able to cross large bodies of water without magical aid; although
in some cases, it may be possible to carefully move through a swamp by
avoiding water squares. Diagonal movement might be helpful here.

Be very careful when moving near water; falling in may cause your
character severe problems, although it isn't normally instantly fatal
unless you're so burdened you can't climb back out. It's often a good
strategy to find an alternative route through this level, if there is
one.
%E
# And it has even less to say about lava...
%Cm - 00234
Tutorial: LAVA

Lava, like water, is represented by the } character (or other custom
character representing liquid); you can use the ; command to tell
water and lava apart, or (if playing in colour) by looking at the
colour difference. You need to be even more careful around lava than
you are around water; few adventurers have the levels of magical
protection needed to be able to swim through lava safely, so a typo
near lava could be instantly fatal. Because NetHack is a turn-based
game, there's no need to react to anything quickly in real-time; so
take your time over your moves!
%E
%Cm - 00235
Tutorial: STAIRS

The > and < characters represent flights of stairs (going down and up
respectively); you can climb down stairs in order to go deeper in the
dungeon. The commands for traversing a flight of stairs are the same
as the characters representing the stairs themselves; and likewise,
the same as the keys representing the vertical directions. Note that
climbing up and down stairs can be difficult if you're holding too
much equipment; for instance, excess weight may cause you to fall down
the stairs, taking damage in the process.

If you can't see the stairs that let you move down from any given
level, try looking underneath items; failing that, bear in mind the
possibility that there may be a secret door or corridor somewhere
leading to another part of the current level. (Of course, the dungeon
isn't infinitely deep; so it's possible you'll find the bottom level,
which has no downstairs. But that isn't something to worry about just
now.)

Note that the stairs that go up from level 1 lead out of the dungeon;
the game will end if you use them.
%E
%Cm - 00236
Tutorial: FOUNTAINS

The { character represents a fountain; it's possible to walk through a
square with a fountain on, but also to interact with the fountain.
Most commonly, an adventurer who chooses to use a fountain will either
want to drink from it, or dip something into it; in either case, this
is accomplished by standing on the square of the fountain, and using
one of the following commands:

    q   Drink (quaff) from the fountain
 #dip   Dip something into the fountain

Note that not all fountains are quite what they seem to be!
%E
%Cm - 00237
Tutorial: THRONES

A backslash character (\) represents an opulent throne. If there's
nothing else on the same square as the throne, you can sit on it by
moving onto the same square and using the #sit command; if there are
items on top of the throne, you'll need to clear them off first, say
by picking them up and dropping them elsewhere.
%E
%Cm - 00238
Tutorial: KITCHEN SINKS

The # character normally represents a corridor; but inside a room, it
has a different use, representing a kitchen sink. Sinks don't have
many obvious uses, although if you feel brave, you could try drinking
from one by standing on the same square as the sink, and pressing q in
order to 'quaff' from it.
%E
%Cm - 00239
Tutorial: GRAVES

The lure of a treasure-filled dungeon is great, and as a result there
tend to be many adventurers seeking their fortune in any given
dungeon. Even though you're the only person here today, there will
have been many other adventurers who sought their fortune, and died
here, in the past; and you just found the grave of one.

Graves are signified by the | symbol inside a room; they don't block
your movement. If the adventurer in question died very recently, then
their body and possessions will likely still exist in the same
location; and quite possibly, so will their ghost, and whatever killed
them! Otherwise, the corpse, along with some of the possessions, will
be buried underground, and if you feel like grave-robbing, you'll have
to dig them up somehow.

Note that it's very common for the possessions of dead adventurers to
be cursed, so be careful with things that you loot from the dead.
%E
# Non-guidebook hints about what sacrifice and prayer actually do.
%Cm - 00240
Tutorial: ALTARS

Religion is an important feature of NetHack; although the gods take
note of your actions all the time, an altar (_) is a good place to go
to contact them more directly. It's important to know who an altar is
dedicated to; to do this, stand on the altar and press the : key.
(Using : will tell you more information about the square you're on.)
As a reminder: your %G is %d.

One common use of an altar is to sacrifice the corpse of a monster to
the appropriate deity; to do this, stand on the altar, with a corpse
in your inventory or on the altar, and use the #offer command. As long
as your %G is not offended by the sacrifice, this will generally
have a pleasing effect; sometimes, your %G will give you gifts in
return for your sacrifices.

Prayer (using #pray) is also more effective when standing on your own
%G's altar; prayer is used to request help from the gods, usually
in emergencies. Deities don't like being pestered too much, so try not
to request divine intervention too often; most of the time, you'll
want to save your prayers for when you're in mortal danger.
%E
%Cm - 00241
Tutorial: DRAWBRIDGES

That's a drawbridge; while open, you can walk over it, but when shut,
it will block your path. Drawbridges are basically just really large
doors; but they tend to have a more complicated mechanism for opening
and closing. You almost certainly don't want to be anywhere near a
drawbridge if it gets destroyed!
%E
%Cm - 00242
Tutorial: TRAPS

The ^ symbol represents a trap. Traps can have a variety of effects,
but generally speaking you want to avoid them; you can look at a trap
with ; to see what it does (or use ^ and a direction when next to it,
if it's buried under items and you can't see the ^ as a result). Some
traps can be dismantled using the #untrap command when adjacent to the
trap; although scavenging the parts that make up a trap can be useful,
it's entirely possible that your character will set the trap off by
mistake when doing so, so be careful and make sure you aren't badly
injured before you try. The #untrap command can also be used to check
chests and doors for traps, although not with a perfect success rate.

Walking round a trap is normally the best option; although if it's
blocking your way and you can't dismantle it, there may be some more
ingenious way to either avoid its effects, or to prevent it
functioning correctly when stepped on.
%E
%Cm - 00259
Tutorial: ESCAPING THE DUNGEON

That < is a flight of stairs going upwards (likewise, a > is a flight
of stairs going downwards); to be precise, those are the stairs you
used to enter the dungeon. If you go up those stairs (by using the <
command), you'll walk straight out of the dungeon and end the game.

Leaving the dungeon via the stairs is known as 'escaping'; escaping
the dungeon is not nearly as bad as death (especially if you get out
with a lot of treasure!), but it isn't really an ideal end to the
game, as you haven't achieved the major aim of the game (offering the
Amulet of Yendor to your god). Of course, if you somehow manage to get
the Amulet of Yendor, there's nothing wrong with taking it out of the
dungeon in an attempt to find an altar to your god somewhere on the
surface, so you can offer the Amulet; the game will continue if you do
this.

Note that once you've left the dungeon wih a character, either with or
without the Amulet, it's impossible to re-enter the dungeon; in order
to play there again, you'll have to start a new game, with a new
character, if you escape.

Tutorial: FASTER MOVEMENT (with vi-style controls)

Moving around one square at a time is useful for tactical reasons
during combat; but it can get boring quickly when trying to explore a
level. Therefore, there are some commands which cause you to continue
moving in the same general direction until something happens:

    g <direction>
        Keep moving in the given direction until something interesting
        happens, or the corridor forks.
    G <direction> or control-<direction>
        Keep moving in the given direction until something interesting
        happens (not including a fork in the corridor).
    M <direction> or   shift-<direction>
        Keep moving in the given direction until no further progress
        is possible (such as bumping into a monster or dead end).

It's up to you to decide how aggressive you want to be in terms of
automatically repeating moves; note that none of these save you time
in-game, just your own time playing. Of course, you need not use these
commands at all; you can just continue moving one square at a time.

Tutorial: AUTOMATIC TRAVEL

Moving back to places in the dungeon that you've already explored can
be a tedious task; luckily, it's possible to automate your movement
somewhat.

The _ command will prompt you for a location anywhere on the current
level; it'll then automatically move you along the shortest path you
know to that location. This doesn't save you any time in-game, but it
can save a lot of real-life time pressing the keys to move back to the
known location one at a time.

In addition, you can aim for a particular location by map symbol; for
instance, you can press _>. to automatically travel to a visible
downstairs, or __. to automatically travel to an altar. This is
particularly useful when going back through several already-explored
levels of the dungeon to reach something higher up.

Travelling will stop automatically if it comes across something
interesting, such as an engraving or a monster.

Tutorial: DIAGONAL MOVEMENT (with vi-style controls)

It seems that you haven't been moving diagonally much recently; this
is a reminder about what diagonal movement is all about. Here's the
cursor movement diagram again, as a reminder:

north-west north north-east      upwards     Note: for orthogonal
       y     k     u                <        movement, hjkl are in a
                                             row on a QWERTY keyboard;
           here                              j's descender goes down,
  west h     .     l east                    k's ascender goes up. The
          at self                            diagonals are the letters
                                             diagonally adjacent to h,
       b     j     n                >        in the corresponding
south-west south south-east     downwards    directions.

Moving diagonally can be an important tactic, as it's generally faster
than moving orthogonally for moving quickly along diagonal corridors;
you can also use it to move round obstacles such as traps without
taking any extra time. It's especially important to use diagonal moves
correctly when trying to outrun a monster.

Tutorial: REPEATING COMMANDS (with vi-style controls)

Getting bored of pressing s repeatedly to search that square? Not only
can repeating a command be boring, it can also be dangerous; holding
down a key, or pressing a button repeatedly without thinking, can both
lead to you failing to react to a monster that turns up, meaning that
it can sometimes get several free hits on you before you stop
repeating and start fighting.

There's a way to automatically repeat commands, however. You can type
a number before more or less any command to automatically repeat the
command that many times; for instance, 20s will search around you 20
times, or until something interesting happens (such as finding what
you were searching for, or until a monster turns up). This sort of
mechanized repetition both saves you time, and reduces the chance of
making a mistake due to distraction.

It's also possible to repeat commands after the fact; pressing
control-A will repeat whatever you just did, which can be useful when
repeatedly trying to open a stuck door, for instance. Generally
speaking, though, control-A is used less than repeat counts.

%Cm - 00267
Tutorial: ITEM PROMPTS

You're about to be asked to choose an item; this probably happened
because you wanted to do something like wear armor or read a scroll,
and the game needed to know which piece of armor to wear, or which
scroll to read. Each item in your inventory is given a letter (case
matters), that you can use to represent the item; so for instance, if
you wanted to wield a weapon in 'slot' a, you could press a in order
to choose that weapon. The prompt will let you know which slots
contain plausible items for the command you selected.

What if you can't remember what's in which slot? There are two more
options for the prompt: ? will give you a list of all the items that
the game thinks are likely choices (such as weapons for a wield
command), and * will give you a list of all the items you have, even
if it would apparently make no sense. (This lets you try out unusual
tactics, such as throwing items which aren't normally thrown, or
wielding things other than weapons.) You can choose the item you want
to use from the resulting menu.

Sometimes, - is also accepted, meaning no item, or bare hands.
%E
%Cm - 00268
Tutorial: UNEQUIPPING MULTIPLE ITEMS

Sometimes, you need to remove multiple pieces of armor in order to
get at the armor underneath; for instance, you might have to take off
your cloak and jacket in order to put on a T-shirt. Likewise, you
might want to take all your armor off at once so you can drop it to
save weight, or remove both your rings so you can put two different
rings on.

The A command allows you to take off armor, remove rings and amulets,
unwield weapons, empty your quiver, and unready a secondary weapon;
therefore, if you need to do two or more of those actions at once for
any reason, using A will often be simpler than typing in each of the
commands manually. It can also be useful if you forget what the
command is to perform a particular sort of unequip action.
%E
%Cm - 00269
Tutorial: NAMING MONSTERS

When there are a lot of similar-looking monsters around, it can be
hard to keep track of what's going on; a lot of messages saying just
"the jackal" or "the soldier ant" tend not to be particularly
informative. In such cases, knowing which monster is which can help
you concentrate on attacking just one monster, rather than spreading
the damage amongst multiple monsters by mistake. It's good practice to
give your pet a name, so you can recognise it if you somehow become
separated from it and it goes wild.

The C command lets you call a monster a particular name; the game's
messages will from then on use that name to refer to the monster,
rather than its species. You can't rename monsters that have a name
already, though, unless it was you who gave them their name in the
first place.
%E
%Cm - 00270
Tutorial: DROPPING MULTIPLE ITEMS

Dropping commands one at a time with d is tedious, slow, and prone to
mistakes when you want to drop a lot of items all at once; it also
takes more game time than is actually needed. The D command works like
d, except that you can specify more than one item to drop; but no
matter how many items you're dropping, it only takes one turn.

Note that in a multiple-select menu, you can use . to automatically
select all options of the menu; combined with the ability to show,
say, only items with unknown blessed/cursed state, or only items that
have been picked up in a shop but not paid for, you can quickly select
entire sets of items you want to get rid of, and drop them. This trick
works in all multiple-select menus, not just d's. (The other menu
commands: - deselects all items, \ deselects items on this page, ^
goes to the first page, ~ inverts all items on this page, | goes to
the last page, > goes to the next page, < goes to the previous page,
. selects all items on the menu, , selects all items on the page, a
number before an item selects that many items from a stack. < > . and
numbers are probably the only commands that are worth memorizing,
though.)

Tutorial: QUICK INVENTORY

A quick interface tip: you can use i, rather than I, to show the whole

through the list, the same way that any other menu works.

Tutorial: SECONDARY WEAPONS

For characters who repeatedly switch between their main weapon and a
secondary weapon (for instance, switching between a melee weapon and a
launcher is rather common), there's a shortcut which can save on
keystrokes and on typos. There's a secondary weapon slot which you can
put an item in to be able to wield it rapidly; to swap your wielded
weapon and secondary weapon, press x. (This is how you fill your
secondary weapon slot in the first place; by wielding a weapon and
swapping it into the slot.)

Tutorial: LOOKING AT THINGS

You haven't used the ; command to look at anything for ages; try using
it more often. Knowing what the symbols on the screen mean is rather
important to be able to play effectively; and even experienced players
need to check now and again, because some symbols can mean more than
one thing. (If your terminal shows colours, that can make it easier to
tell things apart; but even so, some colour/symbol combinations are
ambiguous; is a brown + a closed door or a brown spellbook, for
instance?)

Here's a quick tip about using the ; command; once you've placed the
cursor on whatever you want to look at, you can press : rather than
pressing . in order to view flavour text about whatever you're looking
at; normally this will be a quote from literature, to give you a
better idea of whatever what you're looking at actually is, although
sometimes it's more of a factual description. Have fun!
%E
%Cm - 00274
Tutorial: THE QUIVER

If you're repeatedly throwing the same thrown weapon, or repeatedly
firing the same ammunition from a launcher, you can put whatever
you're throwing in your quiver in order to be able to fire it with
fewer keystrokes.

The Q command allows you to put an item into your quiver; from then
on, you can fire it by pressing f, which works identically to throwing
using t, except that you don't have to specify which item to throw or
fire; instead, the item chosen is the one in your quiver. (Some
characters will start out with their quiver already filled.) The
quiver is simply a convenience option; it doesn't actually do anything
other than selecting an item to throw each time, as everything in your
main inventory is readily accessible (backpack manufacturers really
know how to cater to adventurers well). Still, saving keystrokes
reduces the chance of accidentally throwing the wrong item to quite an
extent.
%E
%Cm - 00280
Tutorial: GETTING HELP

It can be hard to remember everything that goes on in NetHack;
luckily, there are several commands that you can use in order to get
help on how to play.

Most important is probably the ? command, which shows a menu of the
various help possibilities; for instance, ?b shows a list of all the
commands in the game, ?d tells you what the various symbols mean (it
does the same thing as /), and ?e explains what a given key does.

You might also forget the contents of a tutorial message; if so, you
can use the key combination control-V to look again at any tutorial
message you've seen this game (although they may make slightly less
sense out of context). Reviewing tutorials can also be accomplished
via the help menu, ?.

Note that the tutorial menu can get rather long; if it (or any other
menu) doesn't fit on your screen, you can use the < and > keys to page
up and down, or the space key to page through the menu. All menus in
NetHack use these controls, by the way.

%Cm - 00281
Tutorial: ITEMS

It would be unreasonable to expect you to go through the dungeon with
no equipment to help, and no treasure to find. Your inventory contains
items, which you can use to help you through the dungeon; and you can
find items in the dungeon itself, too. Items are represented by
punctuation marks:

$ gold         In order to see what items you have at the moment, use
) weapon       the I command to list a section of your inventory; this
[ armor        will also show you a tutorial message explaining how to
%% edible item  use the items in that section (different items can be
? scroll       used in different ways). As for items in the dungeon,
/ wand         there are two possible ways to pick them up; if the
= ring         autopickup option is on, you'll pick up items when you
! potion       step on them, and if it's off, you'll need to press ,
( tool         in order to pick up items on that square. You can turn
" amulet       autopickup on or off by pressing @. (Note that you can
* rock or gem  have no more than 52 stacks of items in your inventory;
+ spellbook    so be selective about what you leave behind, and what
` statue       you take with you; gold doesn't take up space, though.)
%E
%Cm - 00282
Tutorial: OBJECTIVE

So, why are you here anyway? Like any adventurer, you might just be
here for the treasure; there are plenty of coins and gems in the
dungeon, and you could quite possibly gather them up and retire rich.
Your score will depend mainly on how much treasure you gather, and how
many monsters you kill, although other things affect it too.

More importantly, though, there's a rather significant artifact in the
dungeon; somewhere, probably rather deep down, is the fabled Amulet of
Yendor, allegedly desired even by the gods. You would almost certainly
be rewarded greatly, maybe even with immortality, if you could find it
and offer it to your %G %d.

However, to start with, you should just worry about survival and
exploration. Staying alive, gathering equipment to make yourself more
powerful, and practicing combat are all good aims early on; and you'll
want to explore the dungeon in order to gain an idea of where you want
to go. Even though you'll eventually want to go for the Amulet, you'll
need to discover where it is and how to reach it first; so keep your
aim lower for the time being.

%Cm - 00283
Tutorial: SAVING AND QUITTING

Unlike many other games, in NetHack, death is final; you have to start
a new game from the start (there's no way to save a game and load the
save file more than once). However, if you need to take a break, you
can save the game by pressing S; that will save and end the game. To
reload a save file, just run NetHack again (and if applicable, specify
the same name that you specified last time); the game will load, but
your save file will be deleted.

If you really get fed up of a game, you can use #quit in order to give
up and end the game; quitting a game will end it permanently, though,
because there's no way to go back to an earlier state in a game. So
only do this when you want to abandon the game forever. Quitting does
give a slightly higher final score than death, though.

You can also effectively quit simply by escaping the dungeon using the
stairs that you entered by; leaving the dungeon without the Amulet of
Yendor counts as "escaping", and although you survive with all your
equipment, and your life, intact, the game will end there, and you'll
have to start a new one.

Tutorial: REVIEWING MESSAGES

By now, you're likely to have seen many messages appear at the top of
the screen. That space is used to convey any information that can't
easily be shown on the map in the middle; for instance, it reveals the
results of looking at something using the ; command, explains what's
going on during a fight, and lets you know about things your character
hears while walking around in the dungeon.

However, sometimes it's possible to play too quickly and miss a
message. You can press control-P in order to review messages that
you've heard recently; depending on your options, it might either
display lots of recent messages, or only the most recent (in which
case repeating control-P will tell you about older messages).

If you want to do the opposite, and skip large numbers of messages,
then you can use escape at the --More-- prompt in order to skip the
remaining messages that turn (they can still be reviewed via
control-P, however). (In order to go on to the next message at a
--More-- prompt, use the spacebar or press Return.)

Tutorial: SPELLCASTING

Although so far you've probably been using melee in combat, most
spellcaster characters won't be good enough at fighting to beat
everything in melee; against more powerful opponents, a different
option will be needed. Therefore, it's probably a good time to get
some practice casting spells.

To cast a spell, use the Z command; you can only cast spells in the
eight compass directions (and up, down, and at yourself). For this
combat, "force bolt" is probably a good spell to use; it's easy to
cast, and can do decent amounts of damage even when used by weak
spellcasters. Why not try it on a nearby hostile monster?

In order to power a spell, you'll need to use up some of your personal
magical power; the effort also tends to make you burn food faster.
Your magical power is listed as Pw near the bottom of the screen; it's
depleted by casting spells, and fills up again over time. To start
with, it'll be too low to cast any but the simplest spells, but as
time goes on, you'll be able to handle more powerful ones. Good luck
spellcasting!
%E
%Cm - 00291
Tutorial: THROWN WEAPONS

Although fighting monsters in melee is all very well, it helps if you
can get some hits in before you close in for the kill; a weakened
monster will die faster, and so will deal less damage to you in the
process.

You can throw items at a monster using the t command; good weapons to
throw include darts (which are designed for throwing), and daggers
(which work just as well thrown as when wielded). Some characters will
be better with certain weapons than others; you can use #enhance to
see how skilled you are with various weapons (if a weapon is listed as
'unskilled', you don't know how to use it yet but can learn with
practice; if it isn't listed at all, you won't be able to learn to use
it no matter how much you practice).

Note that even spellcasters can benefit from thrown weapons; because
your magical power (Pw) can run out quickly if you rely on spells as
your major method of combat, using darts or daggers as a backup can be
an important tactic while you're waiting for your magical power to
recharge.
%E
# A bit of tactical advice here as well as than controls advice; but
# it's easy to forget to rewield a melee weapon, and I feel it's
# important to let people know that they have to.
%Cm - 00292
Tutorial: PROJECTILE WEAPONS

Using bows, crossbows, and slings is slightly more complicated than
fighting in melee; but the ability to hit monsters from a distance is
an important one, because it allows you to hit many monsters several
times before they can hit back, meaning you can kill them faster and
take less damage as a result. In order to fire a projectile weapon,
you must wield the weapon (with w), then throw the projectile (using
t); the combination is recognised as firing the projectile with the
weapon, rather than throwing it by hand.

As bashing monsters with a bow or sling is unlikely to do much damage,
it's probably a bad idea to try to use a wielded projectile in melee;
instead, when the opposing monster has almost caught up to you, use
your turn to wield a melee weapon (using w) rather than trying to get
in a final shot.

You can use the #enhance command to see which weapons (including
projectile weapons) your character is good with ('basic' or better),
which they need practice to use ('unskilled'), and which they can
never learn to use effectively (unlisted).
%E

%Cm - 00293
Tutorial: ENGRAVING "ELBERETH"

As you go deeper into the dungeon, the monsters get more and more
dangerous, meaning you'll have to get better at combat yourself; and
if you aren't careful, you might easily be overwhelmed. However,
there's a way to give yourself a bit of breathing space when you're
being swarmed with monsters.

You can write on the floor using a wand or your fingers, using the E
command (E- writes with your fingers); and there is one word that the
vast majority of monsters fear, the word "Elbereth". Writing it on the
ground will therefore cause many monsters to flee from you in terror,
giving you a breathing space to recover from your wounds.

However, there are several problems with this method, too. For one
thing, writing in the dust with your fingers is not the most accurate
method of inscription, so it's possible that one or more of the
letters will be malformed. Also, engravings tend to get scuffed up a
lot by movement; fighting from an Elbereth square will almost
certainly wipe out the engraving and make it ineffective. Finally,
despite the word's power, some monsters simply aren't scared of it.
%E
%Cm - 00294
Tutorial: MORE ABOUT MELEE

When attacking monsters in melee, you hit them with whatever you're
wielding in your hands. However, some weapons are going to work better
than others; it helps to use a weapon your character has had lots of
practice with.

Your ability scores also have an effect on how effective melee can be.  
Your Strength (St:) and Dexterity (Dx:) are shown at the bottom of the
screen; higher ability scores are better, and different abilities
affect different things. Dexterity is imporant in being able to hit
enemies; a good dexterity helps you aim better both with melee and
with thrown and projectile weapons. Strength is also important; it
helps to be strong to be able to aim a melee weapon accurately in
combat, and the stronger you are, the more damage you can do with it
if you connect.

Finally, some weapons will be more powerful than others, especially
against specific opponents. For instance, you can expect swords to
generally hurt your enemies more than daggers do. However, note that
your ability with the weapons in question will be just as important.
%E
%Cm - 00300
Tutorial: GOLD

Every adventurer loves gold; and it can be quite useful even within
the dungeon itself. Gold is represented by the $ symbol, and takes up
no space in your inventory (but its weight can still be significant,
even though coins are quite light); the amount of gold you have is
constantly displayed near the bottom of the screen, rather than in
your inventory.

Gold adds to your score at the end of the game; but even within the
dungeon, it can still be used to buy things. Not every monster is
hostile, and some will want to trade with you; and gold is the perfect
medium to trade with. In particular, you may find shops which will buy
and sell items, in which case you'll want gold to be able to afford
things; but shopkeepers are not the only monsters who care about how
rich you are.

You can get information about your financial situation by using the $
command; normally, this just depends on the gold in your wallet, but
if you owe, or are owed, money, that information will also be
available that way.
%E
%Cm - 00301
Tutorial: WEAPONS

With the number of hostile monsters in the dungeon, weapons tend to be
rather important. Weapons on the map are represented with the ) symbol
(note that ammunition also counts as a weapon for this purpose).

You can use the w command to hold an object in your hands (or w- to
hold nothing); by far the most common use of this is to hold a weapon.
The object in your hands is what you'll use to hit monsters with in
melee, so it should be something that your character is skilled with
attacking with; you can use the #enhance command to see which weapons
your character is good at using ('unskilled' means your character
doesn't yet know how to use the weapon but can learn; if a weapon
isn't mentioned, your character will never know how to use it).

Other uses of weapons include using t to throw them at things (darts
are best used as thrown weapons, daggers are also good for this);
using a to hit targets two squares away (if you have a long weapon
like a lance); and using E to scratch into the floor with the weapon
(note that this damages the weapon). Note that throwing is only
possible in the 8 compass directions (and up and down).
%E
%Cm - 00302
Tutorial: ARMOR

Armor (represented by the [ character) is a useful method of
protecting yourself from the blows of your enemies; armor reduces the
chance that an enemy attack will hit, and may also reduce the damage
it deals. Your vulnerability to attacks is called your Armor Class
(AC, shown at the bottom of the screen); an unarmored human has an AC
of 10, but you'll want to drive it much lower than that.

You can wear armor with W, and take it off again with T; you'll need a
free hand to be able to wear a shield, and likewise you can't wear two
pieces of armor that fit on the same part of the body. Some armor is
magical, and has either a magical bonus (such as +1) to defending you,
or some other property; armor can also be inferior to normal, and have
a penalty (such as -1). The manufacturer of armor is also relevant;
elves are good at making armor, and dwarves are even better, but
orcish armor tends to be rather low in quality.

Note that although anyone can wear armor, it tends to rather get in
the way of spellcasting; metal armor in particular can mess up magic,
and shields also make spellcasting rather difficult.
%E
%Cm - 00303
Tutorial: FOOD

The %% character represents an edible item; note that just because you
can eat something, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea. The
term 'comestibles' is used to represent food and other things that can
be eaten. Eating is rather important; a character who doesn't eat for
too long will become hungry, grow weak, then eventually start fainting
from hunger and starve to death. (If you're getting hungry, this will
be shown near the bottom of the screen.) However, try not to eat when
'satiated'; you can choke to death, as well as starving. You can eat
things (either in your inventory, or on the floor) with the e
command. Fresh food tends to be considerably healthier than food
that's been left to rot; various types of food will spoil over time
and become dangerous, even if they were safe to eat when they first
appeared.

Note that killing monsters also often leaves a %% behind, which is the
monster's corpse. Corpses can be eaten just the same way food can be
(as they tend to be heavy, eating from the floor is usually the best
option). Not all are healthy, but some could give you special powers
when eaten; to some extent, you truly are what you eat.

%Cm - 00304
Tutorial: SCROLLS

Scrolls (?) are magical items that store spells bound up on paper. By
reading a scroll (using the r command), you can unleash the magic
within; but it's rather wise to know what a scroll does, first;
unexpected magical effects can be rather bad for your health. Anyone
can use a scroll, regardless of if they know any magic or not.

If you don't know what a scroll does, you'll see the scroll's label
rather than its function; within any given game, scrolls with the same
label do the same thing, but which label goes on which sort of scroll
can change from one game to the next. (You can use the \ command to
see the label/scroll mappings you've already discovered.) There may be
magical methods of determining what a given scroll does; in fact, one
of the spells commonly bound up in scroll form is a magical means of
determining the properties of an unknown item (such as the spell
written on a scroll).

Magical scrolls are strictly single-use; because the scroll is being
used to capture a spell, the process of casting the spell also
destroys the scroll.

# Wand overcharging is, surprisingly, a Guidebook spoiler.
%Cm - 00305
Tutorial: WANDS

Wands (/) are magical objects, which are generally designed to cast a
specific spell (depending on appearance; wand/appearance combinations
change from game to game). They generally store enough magical energy
to cast that spell multiple times, but will eventually run out; if
somehow you discover the amount of energy in a wand, it will be shown
in the wand's description (e.g. (3:5) means that the wand has been
recharged 3 times, and can be used 5 more times before it next needs
to be recharged). As wands are designed to cast spells by themselves,
you need not know magic yourself to be able to use them; just point
them in the desired direction and fire! You can use the z command to
'zap' a wand like this, to unleash its magic; note that you can only
aim in compass directions (and upwards, downwards, and at yourself).

Other things you can do with wands include writing on the floor with
them (use the E command to do this), and breaking the wand with the a
command; note that breaking a wand often causes an enormous and rather
dangerous release of magical energy. Wands also sometimes explode of
their own accord upon being recharged; the more a wand has been
recharged, the less likely it is to survive another recharging.
%E
%Cm - 00306
Tutorial: RINGS

Unlike wands, scrolls, and potions, rings (=) are a more permanent
sort of magical item; instead of being powered from an in-built
magical source (and therefore running out relatively quickly), most
are powered from your own body's food supply, causing you to get
hungry slightly more quickly (although some powerful rings need more
power than others).

You can put a ring on each ring finger, but only one on each hand; as
a result, you can wear up to two rings. The put-on command, P, is used
to put on a ring; you can remove one using R.

Rings generally have an effect either on you, or on those around you;
note that not all effects are beneficial, and so you should be careful
when trying on rings whose effects you don't know. (The same way as
wands, scrolls, and potions work, rings with the same appearance will
always do the same thing in any given game, but which appearance has
which effect will differ from game to game.) You can use the \ command
to see which ring appearances you already know this game; note that
if you recognise a ring's purpose, your inventory will list it.
%E
# Clear = water is a guidebook spoiler, as is holy water's effect on
# undead.
%Cm - 00307
Tutorial: POTIONS

Potions (!) are magic in liquid form; being single-use magical items,
they work rather similarly to scrolls. You can drink a potion using
the q ('quaff') command. The main difference from scrolls is that as
potions are drunk not read, they affect the person who drank them.

Just as with most other magical items, you may not know what a potion
does upon encountering it; two potions which are the same colour will
do the same thing in any given game, but which colour of potion has
which effect will differ from one game to the next. As some potions
can be very dangerous, be careful when quaffing potions of unknown
enchantment! Clear potions contain water; although water is normally
nonmagical, it might also be holy or unholy water, and because all
three look the same, it might be hard to tell them apart.

Other things you can do with potions include using #dip to dip items
into them, and using t to throw them at things. (Holy water is rather
effective as a thrown weapon against undead, for instance; but
splashing a potion against something normally gives a much weaker
magical effect than drinking it.)
%E
%Cm - 00308
Tutorial: TOOLS

The term 'tool' is used for a broad range of miscellaneous items,
shown with the ( symbol. Although mostly nonmagical, some may have
magical powers; and even the ones that don't are nearly always useful
in some more mundane way. Magical tools often, but not always, will
masquerade as a nonmagical tool, but there will often be some method
of telling the magical tool apart from the ordinary one.

You can use a tool using the a command; what using a tool does depends
on the tool. Some tools can be used an unlimited number of times;
others will wear out, or run out of magic or other supplies. (For
instance, a lamp can run out of oil after a while.) There may be other
commands that make sense in relation to tools, based on their shape;
for instance, some tools are usable as weapons, and so wielding them
using w so you can hit monsters with them makes sense. Luckily, it's
normally obvious what the purpose of a tool is, so you can normally
guess what will happen when you press a and use it.
%E
%Cm - 00309
Tutorial: CONTAINERS

Containers are a special subset of tools (and likewise, are
represented with the ( character), that can be used to store items;
bags, boxes and chests are all generally types of containers. You can
use containers to carry more than 52 stacks of items around with you,
by storing in the container; however, the weight of the items inside
will still be significant, and the weight of the container itself can
be too.

To put items into or take them out of a container in your inventory,
you can use the a command to use the container (just like with any
other tool); if the container is on the floor, you can likewise use
the #loot command to do the same thing. Boxes and chests are often
locked or trapped; you could try using a lock-picking tool on them,
kicking them (using control-D from an adjacent square) in the hope of
breaking open the lock, or trying to force the lock with your wielded
weapon using the #force command. If you're afraid of traps, the
command #untrap can be used to search for traps on the container
(although this is not guaranteed to succeed), and to try to deactivate
them if you find them.
%E
%Cm - 00310
Tutorial: AMULETS

Amulets (") are like rings in more or less every respect; they have
constant magical effects powered from your own body's food supply,
amulets of the same appearance do the same thing in one game, but may
differ from game to game, and you put them on and remove them with the
P and R commands. Amulets are often slightly more powerful than rings,
though; and you wear them around your neck, rather than on your ring
fingers. (You can only wear one amulet at a time.)

As usual, not all magical items are guaranteed to be beneficial; so be
careful trying on amulets you don't recognise.
%E
%Cm - 00311
Tutorial: GEMS AND ROCKS

Gems and rocks (*) are a varied class of items; some are somewhat
valuable, whereas some are worthless, although they are rarely
magical. Unlike other classes of items, two gems of the same colour
are not necessarily the same sort of gem; also, note that even if you
do find a valuable gem, you're unlikely to be able to sell it for very
much unless you can prove its identity to the shopkeeper. Like gold,
valuable gems are useful in increasing your score.

Things you can do with gems and rocks include throwing them (using the
t command; this works better with non-valuable gems such as ordinary
rocks), and rubbing things on them using #rub. (Note that rocks do
more damage as sling ammunition than as thrown weapons.) Mostly,
though, what gems and rocks you do pick up are likely to be carried
around rather than used.
%E
%Cm - 00312
Tutorial: STATUES AND BOULDERS

The ` symbol represents stone objects like statues; your options may
also display boulders using `, although 0 is also a common choice.
Statues tend to be both useless and rather heavy, so make sure you
turn autopickup off when walking over them (you can turn autopickup on
and off using @); however, some statues may not be what they seem.

As opposed to statues, boulders are not only too heavy for almost
anything to lift (although giants and similarly large creatures have
been known to use them as weapons), but too large for the average
character to slip past. Most likely, you'll have to push them out of
your way, or somehow destroy them, if they block your path; you can
push a boulder by walking into it (using the usual movement keys), and
you will try to squeeze past it if you can, and the boulder's movement
is somehow blocked.
%E
%Cm - 00313
Tutorial: SPELLBOOKS

The + character represents a book, generally a spellbook; this is how
characters learn spells. Pretty much anyone can try to learn a spell
by studying a spellbook (use the r command to read a spellbook), using
some of the book's magic to teach them the spell; but if the spell is
too difficult to learn, the attempt can backfire in a rather dangerous
manner. As magic from the book is required, spellbooks will eventually
run out of it, fading and becoming unreadable in the process; and
similarly, you will not be able to retain the memory of how to cast a
spell forever.

Once you learn a spell, you can use the Z command to cast it (or + to
list the spells you know); some spells are easier to cast than others,
and unless your character is particularly good with magic, spells will
have a chance of going wrong when cast. Armor also interferes with
spellcasting, and spells need a source of power; your magical energy
(Pw) is shown at the bottom of the screen, and is used to power spells
(it regenerates over time), and casting spells generally also makes
you hungrier. Lower-level spells are less powerful, but easier and
cheaper to cast, so they may be good spells to practice casting with.
%E
%Cm - 00317
Tutorial: CALLING ITEMS

With all the items around with unknown purposes, it can be very useful
to keep notes on your beliefs about the function of various items. You
are about to be given the chance to give a name to a certain
appearance of item (probably because one was destroyed and you saw the
effects of it); this will replace the appearance from now on, thus
reminding you of what you wrote.

An example: suppose you saw an orange potion break, and got a glimpse
of the sort of effects it had; the game might prompt you with "Call an
orange potion:". This lets you rename orange potions; so, if for
instance you suspected that the potion was dangerous, you could write
"dangerous" at the prompt, and "orange potion" would from then on be
known as "potion called dangerous". As two orange potions always have
the same effect, you'd know to avoid quaffing those potions in future.

If you have nothing to say about what you think the item in question
does, you can just leave the prompt blank, to leave the item with its
old name. (Also, note that you can use #name then n to call items
yourself, rather than waiting for the game to prompt you.)
%E
# Artifacts are only mentioned in the artiwishing-conduct section of
# the Guidebook, but a quick explanation of what they are will
# probably be helpful.
%Cm - 00318
Tutorial: ARTIFACTS

Some items are one of a kind! Artifacts are items with special powers,
often crafted long ago with magic that can no longer be duplicated, or
made by the gods or some similarly powerful beings.

An artifact is identified by its proper name, which cannot be changed;
it will function perfectly well as the item it was based on (e.g. an
artifact longsword can do everything a longsword can), but will often
do other things as well; so for instance, artifact weapons often do
much more damage than a regular weapon would, and artifact tools
normally have one or more permanent magical effects.

Some artifacts tend to be rather picky about who uses them, however;
if you're not the sort of person the artifact wants as its owner, it
might damage you when you touch it, or even refuse to be used
altogether. As always, then, it helps to be wary around artifacts of
unknown function. (Using the / command to ask about the artifact can
be a useful source of information, though; artifacts are sufficiently
famous that your character may have heard of them before ever even
going into the dungeon.)
%E
%Cm - 00319
Tutorial: RANDOM-APPEARANCE ITEMS

A large number of magical items have appearances that vary from game
to game; although within any one game two items with the same
appearance (apart from tools, gems and rocks) will have the same
function, knowledge of what an item does in one game will not help in
the next. Therefore, one of the goals in each game is to try to
determine which item does what.

To avoid having to remember this information, you can use the #name
commands to make notes about the items. If you have an idea of what
one particular appearance of item does, you can use #name followed by
n to produce an alternative name for the appearance; e.g. you could
change "orange potion" to "potion called dangerous" if you decided
that all orange potions in the game were dangerous.

You might also get information about one particular item; for
instance, a curse on one orange potion does not mean that all others
are cursed, but if you found out about it, you'd want to remember.
Using #name followed by y lets you write on an individual item to make
notes about it; this will not affect other items which look the same.
%E
%Cm - 00320
Tutorial: LEVELING UP

Your character just gained an experience level! Going up in level
means you can survive more damage before death, store up more magical
power to cast spells with, heal faster, and become better at casting
spells; some races and all classes will also gain various ongoing
powers as they level up, such as sleep resistance or the ability to
move faster than normal. Many other things also become better for you
the more experienced you are.

It's important to keep on killing monsters so that you can continue
going up in level; as you go deeper, the enemies will get more
powerful, and you'll likely need the benefits that higher levels bring
in order to survive in the deeper parts of the dungeon.
%E
%Cm - 00321
Tutorial: RANKS

You just leveled up again; and as a result, your rank has changed;
you're now have the rank "%r".

Although your rank is mostly irrelevant, a better rank does give you a
somewhat better professional status; a good rank lets you prove to
other people in the game that you have what it takes to perform well
at your chosen job.
%E
%Cm - 00322
Tutorial: ABILITIES

One of your abilities just increased! Demonstrating the use of an
ability helps increase your abilities, making your character more
powerful.

There are six abilities, shown at the bottom of the screen:

Strength     (St:) Affects melee combat and carrying capacity.
Dexterity    (Dx:) Affects your ability to aim at and hit things.
Constitution (Co:) Affects your ability to survive injury.
Intelligence (In:) Affects the power of your spells.
Wisdom       (Wi:) Affects the rate at which you regain magic.
Charisma     (Ch:) Affects enemy's reactions towards you.

Unlike most other stats, abilities are rather hard to change; either
you need to continuously exercise the use of the ability to increase
it, or you need to use some magical means of increasing your abilities
to higher values. You might also find items that boost one or more of
your abilities, letting you function better for as long as you're
using them.
%E
%Cm - 00323
Tutorial: ABILITY ABUSE

One of your abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) just decreased. This happens when
you abuse your mind or body; it can be the result of unwise actions,
of not paying attention to training in a particular sort of activity,
or of actions that monsters or traps tried against you (for instance,
poison tends to seriously abuse abilities, making them very likely to
drop). Unless you can find a magical way to restore your abilities,
you'll need to train in the appropriate area to help to bring your
abilities back up:

Strength     (St:) Affects melee combat and carrying capacity.
Dexterity    (Dx:) Affects your ability to aim at and hit things.
Constitution (Co:) Affects your ability to survive injury.
Intelligence (In:) Affects the power of your spells.
Wisdom       (Wi:) Affects the rate at which you regain magic.
Charisma     (Ch:) Affects enemy's reactions towards you.

Tutorial: GOING DEEPER

Welcome to a deeper level of the dungeon! As you go deeper into the
dungeon, it becomes deadlier and more dangerous; the monsters will be
better at fighting, the traps will be nastier, and you'll need to come
up with ever more ingenious methods to be able to continue onwards.

Note that it's possible to return to previous levels; although most
levels are generated randomly, levels don't change just because you
leave them; the layout will stay the same when you return. Monsters
on a level will stay in stasis while you aren't on the level, meaning
that you can use stairs to run from a fight; but time on the level
still passes, so for instance, food will continue to spoil while you
aren't there. As a result, the main reasons to return to a previous
level are to continue exploring from elsewhere on that level, to pick
up items that you left behind, and to run away from problems on deeper
levels, in favour of healing somewhere that's already been cleared
out.

The dungeon level (Dlvl:) you're on is shown in the bottom-left corner
of your screen. (Some levels have names rather than numbers).
%E
%Cm - 00325
Tutorial: HEALTH

Ouch! You just lost some of your health. Your health is measured in
Hit Points (HP), and is visible at the bottom of the screen; the first
number counts your current hit points, and the number in parentheses
is the maximum number of hit points you can have, when you're fully
healed.

You should be careful to try to conserve your HP, because when you run
out of them, you die. Luckily, your wounds will slowly heal over time;
so you can regain your HP simply by avoiding being hit for a while. If
you end up critically low on HP, you'll probably want to find some way
to accelerate the healing process; if you find a reliable way to do
this, make sure you remember what it is, to help you in emergencies.

Your Constitution (Co:) ability is also shown at the bottom of the
screen; it reflects how naturally good you are at surviving injury. A
high Constitution will help you to heal faster, and give you more hit
points to start with; so improving your Constitution is a helpful way
to survive better.

It looks like you just used some of your magical power. There are
several uses for it, although the main use is to cast spells. The
amount of magical power you have is shown as Pw at the bottom of the
screen; the first number counts your current power reserves, and the
number in parentheses shows the maximum amount of power your body can
store at one time. You regenerate magical power slowly over time;
nothing particularly bad happens if you run out, but if you don't have
enough power, you can't cast spells, or perform other actions that
need you to power them with personal magic.

The amount of power you have depends on your Wisdom ability (shown as
Wi: at the bottom of the screen); gaining more Wisdom will give you
more maximum power, and help you regenerate it faster. There's another
ability relevant to magic; your Intelligence ability (shown as In: at
the bottom of the screen) also helps regenerate your magical power,
makes it easier to understand spellbooks you might find, and makes
your spells more powerful.

Tutorial: ALTERNATIVES TO MAGIC

It seems that your magical power has now run so low that you can't
cast any more spells, until it regenerates. If your character relies
on magic, then you could be in trouble.

There are several things you could do here. If there are no monsters
around, you might want to retreat to an area of the dungeon you've
already cleared out, to wait for your power to regenerate. You might
also want to let your pet do the fighting for a while, if you have
one; although you probably don't want to expose it to too much danger.

Alternatively, you could try some non-magical combat yourself. Even
spellcasting classes should practice with a weapon so that they can
fight in melee if they have to; thrown or projectile weapons are also
very useful for weakening monsters without exposing yourself to danger
in return. It helps to get some practice with weapons against weaker
monsters, so that you aren't completely helpless against stronger
monsters when you run out of magic against them.

Tutorial: USING ARMOR

Your Armor Class (AC) has just decreased; as Armor Class measures how
vulnerable you are to attacks, this is a good thing. Being better
armored reduces the chance that monsters will be able to hit you (as
armor helps to parry attacks); if you manage to get sufficiently well
armored, your body will be so well covered that the armor will be hard
to avoid, meaning that even when the attacks do connect, their damage
will be reduced.

Of course, there are always tradeoffs. One potential problem with
wearing a lot of metal armor is that it makes spellcasting
difficult, although this is not a problem unless you intend to cast
spells. Another potential issue is that the weight of armor can
encumber you, making you move more slowly and making you more
vulnerable as a result. Shields take up a hand that you could be using
to hold a weapon. Finally, there are several magical items that need
to be worn on parts of your body normally used for armor; so there may
eventually be a trade-off between armoring yourself well and gaining
magical benefits. However, especially early on, the value of armor is
often large enough to outweigh all this.

%Cm - 00329
Tutorial: EXPERIENCE

You just gained some experience! By far, killing monsters is the most
common way to gain experience, although there are a few weirder
methods (some experienced NetHack players have completed the game
without a single kill, although this is incredibly difficult to
achieve).

Accumulating experience is important, because it will eventually allow
you to level up, giving you a boost in maximum health and magical
power, making you better at spellcasting, and gaining you new special
abilities. As a result, early on in the game you probably want to kill
more or less everything hostile, for the practice; later on, though,
some monsters will be better avoided than fought.

Pets can get experience too; it's getting the final blow in that gives
the experience, so if you're trying to keep a pet, you'll need to
think carefully about which of you should get the experience from any
given death.
%E
# 'people' here is D&D terminology for player-character races; saying
# 'humans' would be wrong, because the character might not be human.
%Cm - 00330
Tutorial: HUNGER

You're getting hungry; now would be an especially good time to eat
something. When you're hungry, your hunger status (such as "Hungry",
"Weak", or "Fainting") will be displayed at the bottom of the screen;
merely being hungry isn't disastrous, but becoming too hungry can kill
you easily, either directly by starving to death, or indirectly by
making you too weak to defend yourself.

Therefore, you'd better try to find something to eat. The corpses of
monsters are often edible; although many sorts of food spoil over
time, so fresh corpses are more likely to be healthy. An important
skill is learning what's safe to eat, and what will kill you.

You can also try eating food from your inventory; you can use I to see
which "comestibles" you're carrying around. Some sorts of food are
best saved for when you can't find any monsters around to kill and
eat; food designed for people to eat is often especially nutritious
and can get you out of starvation trouble quickly.

Use the e command to eat food, from the floor or your inventory.
%E
# The Guidebook doesn't actually say what satiation does; but it's
# rather easy to find out by experiment
%Cm - 00331
Tutorial: SATIATION

There's an opposite problem to hunger; eating too much can make you
satiated, which can be bad for your health. When satiated, eating yet
more food could be a bad idea, as there's a limit to how much your
stomach can hold; you might end up choking to death!

If there are things you really feel you need to eat, you could try
burning off some of those calories first; several sorts of magic
(spells, rings, and amulets) power themselves from your body's food
supplies, so you could try using those. You might also find other
calorie-burning actions as the game progresses.

Mostly, though, the easiest way to burn off the calories will simply
be to continue adventuring until you naturally end up hungry again;
after all, food doesn't last forever.
%E
%Cm - 00332
Tutorial: STATUS

Status effects are effects like confusion or blindness that affect
your character negatively, making it harder to act correctly. They're
displayed at the bottom of the screen. Some status effects can kill
you directly, as you die from illness or food poisoning; others are
dangerous more indirectly, as they impair your senses or your actions,
making it considerably easier for monsters to kill you. Therefore,
it's probably advisable to try to cure the status.

If the status is not fatal in itself, you may be able to cure yourself
simply by waiting somewhere where there are fewer monsters, trying to
survive until your body recovers; but this will just make things worse
in some cases. Your main alternatives are to try to find an item or
spell that will cure you. Also, although it's too late now, it's often
possible to avoid the status in the first place; for instance, it's
advisable not to eat monster corpses that will give you status
effects (you can find out which these are by experimenting over the
course of several games). Asking for divine intervention with #pray
may save your life, too, in the most serious cases; but this should be
treated as a last resort, as deities dislike being bothered too much.
%E
%Cm - 00333
Tutorial: ENHANCING SKILLS

Practicing a particular area of fighting, weaponry, or magic, will
allow you to get better in it, to some extent. Your character now has
enough practice to be able to 'enhance' a skill, becoming better at
it; to do this, use the #enhance command.

Note that the total amount of skill enhancement you can manage depends
on your experience level; as a result, if you somehow get enough
practice to enhance a skill you aren't planning to use, it may be a
good idea to decide not to enhance that skill, so as to save your
skill slots for some other skill. Likewise, if there's some skill you
are planning to use in the future, it may be worth practicing it now,
so that it's enhanced ready for you to be able to use it.

Only skills listed in the #enhance list are enhanceable at all; most
characters will have some skills they'll never be able to get good
at. Similarly, the maximum competence you can gain in a skill (basic,
skilled, expert, master, grand master) will depend on your class; for
instance, a competence of 'master' or better can only be achieved in
martial arts or unarmed combat, and even then, only by some classes.
%E
%Cm - 00334
Tutorial: POLYMORPHED

It seems that you've just turned into a monster! Monsters tend to have
their own strengths and weaknesses, which are likely quite different
from the ones you have in your original form; it may help to
experiment a bit to see what you can and can't do now. It's entirely
possible that some things you took for granted, such as the ability to
open doors, are no longer possible in this form.

Some monsters have a special attack or ability; if you do, you'll have
been told what it was, and you can use the #monster command to use it.
Some female monsters can also lay eggs, which you can do with the #sit
command. If you're stuck in monster form, you may as well try to make
the most of it!
%E
# Wands are shown in-game in the "plausible items" list for engraving;

%Cm - 00335
Tutorial: ENGRAVINGS

There seems to have been something written on the square you stepped
on. Although it's rare for writing to survive a long time in a
dungeon, writing on the floor can be a useful technique to avoid
getting lost, or to record information; other denizens of the dungeon
might also be using it to try to communicate with you.

You can write on the floor yourself, too, using the E command. You can
write in the dust with your fingers using E-, but such writing tends
to erode incredibly quickly; scratching into the ground with a metal
weapon or similarly hard object will last longer, but note that this
will damage the weapon. Some magical wands can be used for writing,
too.
%E
%Cm - 00336
Tutorial: PRAYER

You seem to be in serious trouble! Sometimes, you end up badly
injured, starving to death, have both hands welded to a cursed weapon,
or have some equally serious issue; and in such cases, there's a last
resort you can try.

As long as you've been careful not to do anything too sacrilegious,
and have been advancing the cause of your religion (killing hostile
monsters is generally a good way to do this), calling upon your
%G (%d) may help.

Prayer is accomplished by the #pray command; although you can't rely
on divine intervention too often, it can get you out of problematic
situations reliably, if you don't do it so much that your %G
becomes annoyed. Care is needed; an annoyed deity can do all sorts of
drastic things to you! If you do annoy your %G by mistake, or
you want to please them so you can pray more quickly, you might want
to find an altar dedicated to them and use #offer to sacrifice a
recently killed monster; as long as the offer isn't offensive, you
can gain standing in the eye of your %G this way.
%E
%Cm - 00337
Tutorial: ENCUMBERANCE

One problem that every adventurer seems to face is the problem of
hauling all that treasure around. Your Strength ability (shown as St:
at the bottom of the screen) is important in influencing how much you
can carry (and also has a large effect on the effectiveness of your
fighting in melee); you generally want to be strong to be able to
carry a lot of gear. (Constitution (Co:) is also relevant.)

The more you have on you, the more and more burdened you become; if
you're having trouble carrying your equipment, the bottom of the
screen will show your encumberance status, ranging from "Burdened"
through "Stressed", "Strained", and "Overtaxed" up to "Overloaded".
The more encumbered you are, the slower you'll perform all actions,
and the more often you'll need to eat; being slower means that the
movements of monsters will seem faster by comparison, which could be
rather dangerous for you. As a result, try discarding items to save
weight; you can come back to them later.

You can use the d command in order to drop an unwanted item; dropping
several items now is probably a good idea.
%E
%Cm - 00338
Tutorial: CURSES

Some items bear curses, which make them considerably worse; you seem
to have come across such an item. Curses are generally not incredibly
bad; mostly they make an object less effective than it would be
otherwise, although sometimes they have other negative or detrimental
effects. Cursed equipment also tends not to want to be unequipped; you
normally need to find some magical method of lifting the curse to be
able to get rid of it.

There's an opposite to curses, too; an item can be blessed, which will
make it more beneficial (or in the case of dangerous items, less
bad). For instance, demons are injured more badly by blessed weapons.
A blessing or a curse on water is what makes it holy or unholy water,
respectively.

Your inventory will list a blessing or a curse on any objects for
which you find out that information; if you know for certain an object
is neither blessed nor cursed, it'll be marked as "uncursed". There
won't be a notation at all if you aren't sure, though.
%E
%Cm - 00339
Tutorial: MAIL

You've got mail! If someone sends you a message, a mail daemon will
turn up and give it to you; it'll appear in the form of a scroll, and
reading the scroll will allow you to check what the message was. The
form of the message will depend on where and how you're playing; if
you're on your own computer, then the scroll will normally be a
response to the receipt of email, in which case you can read the
scroll to read the email; but when playing on a public NetHack server,
the mail will probably be related to your game, sent by someone
watching. In this case, you can effectively send a reply by pressing
#, then space, then typing in your message and leaving it on the
screen for a while; whoever's watching your game (and sent the mail)
will be able to read the response on your screen.

If you get fed up of being sent mail all the time, you can turn this
option off, by using O to enter the options screen, and turning off
the 'mail' option.
%E
%Cm - 00340
Tutorial: SPELLCASTING AND ARMOR

Spellcasting is always a matter of trade-offs; using up magical power,
and burning calories, are things that cannot be kept up forever, so
you generally need to think carefully about when to use spells and
when to use more mundane methods. There's another issue that causes
problems when spellcasting, though; whether to wear armor.

Metal armor tends to block magic, and shields get in the way of the
complex hand motions needed to cast a spell properly; as a result,
wearing metal armor or a shield can really mess up your chances of
casting spells correctly. You can use + to see your spell failure
chances, to help you make an informed decision about whether the
armor is worth it or not. If you're particularly good at magic, it's
possible that easier spells will be 100% successful despite the
armor; in this case, you might want to confine yourself to low-level
spells, and wear the armor for extra protection. Later in the game,
though, you'll probably want to cast higher-level spells, and may have
to ditch the armor (or change to non-metallic armor) as a result. If
you aren't that good at magic, then it may also be worth considering
just ignoring magic altogether and using whatever armor you can find.
%E
%Cm - 00341
Tutorial: WEAPON CHOICE

The weapon you're currently wielding isn't one that your character is
particularly good with. Choosing an appropriate weapon can be quite a
problem, especially if none of the weapons that you've learnt so far
are particularly effective.

You can use the #enhance command to see which weapons your character
knows how to use, and which ones you can learn; any skill that's
listed can be learnt, but you'll never be any good with weapons that
aren't mentioned. If you do decide to learn a new weapon, make sure
it's one that it's possible to learn, and then practice it against
weaker enemies; with a weapon you aren't trained in, you're going to
find it hard to hit and to deal significant damage, until you've had a
lot of practice. (It may be worth going higher up in the dungeon to
find weaker opponents to train against, as a result.)

Alternatively, you could just switch back to a weapon you already know
how to use; most characters will be able to become highly proficient
with their starting weapon, over time, so that can be a good choice.
%E
%Cm - 00342
Tutorial: ENGULFED

It seems that you've been swallowed by a monster! Various monsters
prefer to engulf, swallow, or otherwise absorb their prey whole,
rather than relying on the usual methods of combat. As a result,
you're going to have to fight your way out from the inside.

When engulfed, all 8 compass directions count as attacks against the
monster; so for instance, moving in any direction will melee it. You
can use spells inside a monster, too (casting in any direction); and
likewise, zapping wands at it may be a useful way to escape.

Generally speaking, you need to get out before the monster does
whatever unpleasant things it's planning to do to you; being digested
is a rather final end to a game, and the insides of most monsters will
deal damage to you, or injure you some other way. However, you're
unlikely to have much trouble hitting the monster from here!
%E
%Cm - 00359
Tutorial: DEATH

Every game comes to an end, and unfortunately, this one has ended with
your character's death. It looks like someone else is going to have to
retrieve the Amulet.

When you die, your score is calculated, based mostly on the treasure
you had and the monsters you killed. You're also told what items you
had, and what your character was like; the information you're shown
this way can help you to figure out what went wrong. Death in NetHack
is fatal; you'll need to start again with a new character. Learn from
your death, and try to do better next time!

If you keep on dying, there's an easier mode you can play in to gain
some practice, which doesn't count for the high score tables but in
which death is not fatal, so you can keep on trying things out. To
enter "explore mode", as it's called, type X whilst playing a game;
that will convert the game into a non-scoring explore-mode game. Once
you get the hang of playing, though, go back to normal play for your
games after that; wins in explore-mode don't count.
%E
%Cm - 00360
Tutorial: SHOPPING

A dungeon may seem a rather strange place to set up a shop, but some
hardy shopkeepers attempt to make the best of the commercial potential
that a dungeon has to offer. You can use your money to buy the items
on offer in the shop; or if you have items that the shopkeeper is
interested in, you can try selling them.

Apart from the square just inside the door (which doesn't count as
part of the shop), items in the shop are the shopkeeper's property;
you can pick them up to examine them, but the shopkeeper will get
annoyed if you damage them. Once you're holding an item you want to
buy, you can use the p command to pay for it, and it'll become yours.
Similarly, you can drop items inside the shop, and if the shopkeeper
is interested he or she will offer to pay for them (if you decline the
offer, you can simply pick them back up again).

Note that leaving autopickup on in a shop is generally a bad idea; you
can use the @ command to turn autopickup on or off. (You don't want to
end up buying everything in the shop by mistake!)
%E
%Cm - 00361
Tutorial: PURCHASING ITEMS

Well, you're now holding one of the shopkeeper's items! Try not to
damage it, or you'll have to pay for it. (Of course, if you're
planning to buy it anyway, you could use it now and pay for it later;
but paying first is a prudent strategy, as shopkeepers are used to
having to take their produce back by force.)

There are three commands that you may find useful in relation to
unpaid items; you can use p to pay for an item, $ to check how much
money you owe the shopkeeper (or vice versa), and d to drop the item
if you decide you don't want it after all.

Note that as an alternative to picking up items to find out how much
they cost, you can use the #chat command while standing on the item,
to talk to the shopkeeper; this can help to reduce the chance that you
damage an item that you can't afford to pay for.

Your Charisma ability (shown as Ch: at the bottom of the screen) is
useful when shopping; a stronger personality and more attractive
manner can help you to haggle better prices.

# Branches and special levels. The three mentioned here (the Mines,
# Sokoban, and the Oracle) are all mentioned in the Guidebook.
%Cm - 00362
Tutorial: THE GNOMISH MINES

It's long been rumoured that the gnomes have built a mine complex
somewhere in the dungeons; and it looks like you just found it. There
are several side-branches to the main dungeon, and the mines are the
first one; although branches are mostly optional, they can be
rewarding. (What adventurer wouldn't want to explore a working gem
mine?)

In general, levels only have two sets of stairs (one going up, one
going down); but the entries to branches are different, having another
set of stairs that leads to the branch. (The level before the Mines,
for instance, has some stairs leading to the Mines, and some stairs
continuing along the main dungeon.) The ends of branches are also
special; eventually, if you explore right the way to the bottom of the
mines, you'll hit a dead end which has stairs up but no stairs down.
Most players do choose to (immediately or eventually) explore side
branches that they find, though; the riches to be found there are
often similar or better to those in the main dungeon.
%E
%Cm - 00363
Tutorial: SOKOBAN

Welcome to a dungeon side-branch! Although mostly optional, branches
of the dungeon can be rewarding to explore, even if they do eventually
lead to dead ends.

You're now in Sokoban, a rather unusual area of the dungeon full of
boulder puzzles. The aim here is to push the boulders into the pits or
holes; that way, you can complete a path leading to the next level.
It's possible to complete all the puzzles here according to the
traditional Sokoban rules; however, by taking NetHack physics, and the
possibility to use magic, into account, you may find certain rather
more ingenious ways to solve the puzzle. However, players who cheat
too badly at the puzzles may find themselves having a run of bad luck.

In order to help you solve the puzzles in an informed manner, you'll
be magically informed of the map on each level of Sokoban, so the aim
here is mostly to solve the puzzles. Items and monsters do not show up
until they're in your vision range, though; so exploring the levels
can still be useful. There's no undoing moves; so think carefully
before moving any of the boulders!
%E
# What the oracle does is not a Guidebook spoiler, but is obvious.
%Cm - 00364
Tutorial: THE ORACLE

Welcome to the Oracle! Although most of the levels in NetHack are
generated at random, some will have predetermined areas, or be unusual
in various other ways; for instance, the Oracle of Delphi has a
specially designed room all to herself, from which she makes
prophecies.

You can chat to the Oracle using the #chat command; she'll be willing
to give you advice in return for money. The Oracle's consultations are
full of useful, if potentially obscure, information about the game;
you can gain a lot of information that way.

There are more 'special levels' deeper in the dungeon; but you'll have
to figure out how those ones work for yourself.
%E
