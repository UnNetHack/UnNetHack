   This is version 1.5 of the menucolors patch.

   This patch allows the user to define in what color menus are shown.
   For example, putting

   OPTIONS=menucolors
   MENUCOLOR=" blessed "=green
   MENUCOLOR=" holy "=green
   MENUCOLOR=" cursed "=red
   MENUCOLOR=" unholy "=red
   MENUCOLOR=" cursed .* (being worn)"=orange&underline

   in the configuration file makes all known blessed items
   show up in green, all cursed items show up in red and
   all cursed worn items show up in orange and underlined
   when viewing inventory.

   Colors: black, red, green, brown, blue, magenta, cyan, gray, orange,
           lightgreen, yellow, lightblue, lightmagenta, lightcyan, white.
   Attributes: none, bold, dim, underline, blink, inverse.

   Note that the terminal is free to interpret the attributes however
   it wants.


   TODO/BUGS:

    o Only works with TTY and Windows GUI.
    o You can't use '=' or '&' in the match-string.
    o Maybe add color-field to tty_menu_item in include/wintty.h
      (so there's no need to find the color for the line again)
    o Guidebook is not up to date
    o Better place to put the functions, colornames[] and attrnames[]?
    o Some menus do not need coloring; maybe add new parameter
      to process_menu_window()?


   FIXES:

   v1.5:
    o Partial support for Windows GUI windowport; supports colors,
      but not attributes.

   v1.4:
    o Option to use standard instead of GNU regex functions.

   v1.3:
    o Updated to use 3.4.3 codebase.
    o Added a text to #version to show menucolors is compiled in.

   v1.2:
    o Updated to use 3.4.2 codebase.

   v1.1:
    o Updated to use 3.4.1 codebase.
    o replaced USE_REGEX_MATCH with MENU_COLOR_REGEX

   v1.04:
    o Oops! 1.03 worked only on *nixes... (GNU regex.h)
    o Compile-time option USE_REGEX_MATCH: if it's defined, use regex,
      otherwise use globbing. ('?' and '*' wildcards)

   v1.03:

    o Now using Nethack 3.4.0 codebase
    o Compile-time option MENU_COLOR
    o Strings match using regular expressions instead of globbing
    o You can use attribute with color (attr must come after '&')
    o Use ``MENUCOLOR="foo"=color'' instead of ``OPTIONS=menucolor=...''
      (Both work, but OPTIONS complains if you define menucolor
      more than once)

   v1.02:

    o Should now work with OS/2, thanks to Jukka Lahtinen
    o Strings match now using simple globbing. ('?' and '*' wildcards)

   v1.01:

    o Moved 'menucolors' boolean option, so now the options-menu
      is in alphabetical order.
    o Fixed 'menucolor' description in dat/opthelp.
    o menu_colorings is now initialized to null in src/decl.c.

   v1.0:

    o Initial release
