 * this relies on the fact that nethack's `boolean' is really stored
 * in a `char' (or bigger type) rather than in a single bit.
 *
 * 3.4.1 save and bones files will be correct.
 * 3.4.0 save files restored under 3.4.1 will be correct.
 * 3.4.0 bones files used with 3.4.1 will continue to have the minor
