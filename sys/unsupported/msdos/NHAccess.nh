# Modified defaults.nh for blind access.  Copy to working directory as
# defaults.nh.
#
# A '#' at the beginning of a line means the rest of the line is a comment.
#
# This configuration file is set up for two cases, for a hard disk
# (as drive C:), and for two floppy disks.
#
# Some options MUST be set in this file, other options can be toggled while
# playing.  For a list of options available see the <opthelp.> file.  If
# the game plays slowly you might notice some improvement by setting
# !time and !showexp, which will reduce screen I/O somewhat.
#
# To change the configuration, comment out the unwanted lines, and
# uncomment the configuration you want.


# *** OPTIONS ***
#
# The three options on this line should be used for most setups.  
# If your machine isn't very IBM-compatible, and NetHack doesn't work, 
# try commenting out this line.
#
# Note to blind players:
#
# Turn off IBMgraphics, using the exclamation-mark, as done below.
#
OPTIONS=rawio,BIOS,!IBMgraphics
# Some versions of NetHack use the pc speaker to play the notes given when
# playing music instruments in NetHack.  To use this feature, if available,
# uncomment the following line:
#OPTIONS=soundcard:autodetect
#
#
# General options.  You might also set "silent" so as not to attract
# the boss's attention.
#
# Note for blind players:
#
# A lot of speech access programs use the number-pad to review the screen.
# If this is the case, exclamation-mark out the number_pad option (as done
# below) and use the traditional Rogue-like commands.
#
OPTIONS=notime,noshowexp,!number_pad,lit_corridor,!rest_on_space
#
#
# Some options to set personal preferences.  Uncomment and change these to
# suit your personal preference.  If several people are to use the same
# configuration, options like these should not be set.
#
# Note to blind players:
#
# Use menustyle:traditional for the best interface to speech synthesizers.

# *** HARD DISK CONFIGURATION ***
#
#HACKDIR=c:\games\nethack
# 
# Note: Under MSDOS ports HACKDIR defaults to the location 
#       of the NetHack.exe file. Setting HACKDIR above will override that.
#
#   LEVELS and SAVE default to HACKDIR
#
#LEVELS=c:\games\nethack\bones
#SAVE=c:\games\nethack\bones;n
#
#   appending a ";n" to SAVE means don't prompt to insert a disk.
SAVE=;n
#
# Note that RAMDISK must *not* be the same (or even implicitly
# get expanded to the same path by the OS) as HACKDIR.
#
#RAMDISK=d:


# *** 2-FLOPPY CONFIGURATION ***
#
# HACKDIR=a:\
# LEVELS=b:\
# SAVE=b:\
# RAMDISK=c:


# *** CHARACTER GRAPHICS ***
#
# See the on-line help or the Guidebook for which symbols are in which
# positions.
#
# Note to blind players:
#
# You very probably do not want to use these character graphics.
#
# If you merely set the IBMgraphics option, NetHack will use IBM
# extended ASCII for dungeon characters.  If you don't like the selections,
# you can make up your own via these graphics options, but you should still
# set IBMgraphics if you are using IBM graphics characters to get the correct
# processing.
